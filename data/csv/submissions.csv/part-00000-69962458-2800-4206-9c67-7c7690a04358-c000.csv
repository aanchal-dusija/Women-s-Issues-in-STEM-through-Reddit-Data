AskMen,ifearbears,Do you want your girl to tell you when she’s on her period?,"I’ve recently starting dating a new guy. We work together so we see each other almost daily, and text a lot when we don’t.

I have really awful periods that basically keep me in bed on the first day because of the pain. (I’ve been to the doctor about it, apparently nothing’s wrong.) I got my period today and he was texting me asking how my day went. It was horrible, because I was doubled over with cramps all day. I didn’t want to just dump all that on him though so I said it was okay.

If your girlfriend is in pain because of her period would you want her to tell you, or to just keep it to herself? I know there’s not really anything he could do to help but idk.

Edit: wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up! Thanks for the awards and advice everyone. :) My doctor didn’t dismiss me, he sent me for bloodwork and an ultrasound when I first brought it up and everything came back normal. He also did a test where he felt my abdomen to see if anything felt off, and nothing did. I don’t have any of the symptoms of endo other than bad pain on my period. I’ve been on the pill since I went to the doctors, and it’s really helped. Now I’m only in pain on the first day instead of the whole week. Thanks for your concern and advice!",2021-01-08T10:02:39.000Z,3559

AskMen,[deleted],How to ask neighbour to be quiet at night? He shouts swear words really loud,"I, woman (30 years old, only 5’0”) live alone in an apartment and my upstairs neighbour shouts swear words around midnight. He sounds really angry. Based on his voice, I am assuming he is around 30 years old. At first I thought he is having fights with his girlfriend, but I never hear her or them having sex. He sometimes shouts during the day too, but it doesn’t bother me that much. 


In the middle of the night, I am trying to sleep, I wake up, my heart starts pounding, I cannot calm down, his swearing and shouting makes me nervous. I am not sure if he is playing games, watched tv or what is going on. 


What should I do? I think walking to his door and asking to lower his voice won’t solve anything. I am also short/small person and I am kinda scared what he might do.


Edit: I do not know him or what he looks like. There are 120+ apartments and people keep for themselves. I don’t know his landlord, a company we pay expenses is not in charge of noise or cannot throw people out.",2021-01-13T09:47:08.000Z,122

AskMen,goodusername883,"Men who have gone through the sort of negative experiences that's typically assumed only women go through, how do you deal with discussing it afterwards? And what lasting effects have you noticed on yourself?","I can only say from personal experience, I've gone through things that it's not assumed happen to men - sexually assaulted, sexually harassed, \"mansplained\" to and been in an emotionally abusive relationship. The vast majority of these experiences come at the hands of women but I have had a few of these things come from men too. Although on a personal level, it hurts more when women do it (and I can't explain why that is).

I find though I very rarely discuss it, and even I do it's only ever anonymously. Mainly because I feel people don't believe me? Or that it's not as bad because I'm statistically an anomaly and it's not a typical \"male experience\"? So therefore isn't as harmful. Plus before when I used to bring it up, it was in the middle of an existing discussion and told to shut up because I was derailing the conversation as a man and it was harmful. So I don't even seek those discussions out anymore. 

In terms of lasting effects, I feel it's made me a fairly resentful person. Like I probably won't get involved in efforts to fight the above social injustices and fight against people who try to get me to. Mainly because I have the mindset \"well no one helped me or laughed at me when this happened so why should I help you?\" I know that isn't helpful or probably not a good thing, but it is definitely true of myself. 

So I ask others who have had the same experience as myself, how do you or even do you discuss your experience with others? And what are the lasting effects you have noticed on yourself?",2021-01-30T14:29:08.000Z,55

Even watching a film or something with an element of romance in just sort of hurts because it feels so far away.

From what I remember I started to feel a bit like this since maybe age 16, but it's gradually increased, and now I'm at the point where it's really dragging me down.

I've (M18) never been in a relationship, and don't see myself being in a position to be in one for a good few years due to religious beliefs and also my educational/career life.

But yeah I just wanted to know if/when you guys started to feel like this and if it's normal, and how you dealt with it all.

AskMen,rbfjunkie,Wife and I are buying a house. She signed a formal offer without my name on it. How do I approach her and not come off as an a-hole?,"First things first, her name will be the only one on the mortgage. My credit was a hair too low for getting guaranteed approval, so we just used her credit. She sent a formal offer to our mortgage broker but didn't include my name on it. Her logic was \"I've seen enough Judge Judy\" and left it at that. 

What I feel like this says to me is she doesn't necessarily see us together in the future and would do absolutely anything to keep the house, and that she doesn't really want me to sign it because she feels like we'll end in a divorce anyway. I'm confused on how to feel, or if what I am feeling is true or exaggerated or just completely stupid. 

We've been together for going on 6 years, married one. I see us being together forever, but I feel like she doesn't after this incident.

Whenever I bring up issues, she tends to get immediately defensive and act like it's not a big deal, I'm overreacting, I should stop being \"butthurt,\" which makes this issue, which I feel is gigantic, almost an unapproachable topic given how she normally reacts. Any advice helps, thanks",2021-01-12T15:00:35.000Z,52

Lippy Kids - Elbow
https://youtu.be/NItwaz0nLJA

This is a song that was introduced to me by my old man, he played a big role in shaping a portion of my music taste, I think we all experience that from our family members especially growing up. I have so many memories growing up of him blasting Elbow through the speakers. It takes me back to my childhood like nothing else.

But it really hit a new height while I was in Vietnam. I was an 18 year old kid, whod left school the year before to save money to solo backpack SE Asia. As I'm sure many of us have experienced, I struggled with some emotional manipulation from some very shitty people whom I assumed reciprocated the love I had for them. Ontop of being bullied when I was younger, self love was nonexistent. Along with confidence.

Vietnam was the second country I'd visited and I'd just turned 19 the day before this happened. I'd met this German girl who'd I'd really got along with, we were sat by the pool and as you do while in SE Asia. Smoking 60c packs of Malboros golds and drinking 1$ beers. She'd asked me this question, and I'd explained it all in depth without telling her the name of the song. As we lay on this couch I played the song and we sat in silence until the first line comes in. Under her breath she mutters the first line along with me... \"Lippy kids on the corner again\" 

Goosebumps, instantly. I'm so taken back that she has a big smile on her face, we don't say a word and start to sing the song together. Arms up in the air, heads thrown back. A beautiful moment. Halfway through and I can't help it anymore, my eyes water up and I turn to look at her. She buries herself in my arms as we very drunkenly sing this together. I'd never felt so vulnerable, especially to someone I'd only met the night before. It was a feeling I can't describe. I don't think she realises how much that moment changed my life with the conversation that followed. She was a true ray of sunshine who played a massive role in who I have become since. A very fitting line in the song became a big reality after this night. \"Nobody knows me at home anymore\"

I'd suggest reading the lyrics of Lippy Kids if you haven't got the ear for lyrical content. I promise I'tll take you back to your teenage years, and all the crazy memories we all have from that time.


Ocean - John Butler
https://youtu.be/jdYJf_ybyVo

As a guitarist this quickly became the only song I played for a long time. I think I poured every emotion from every 3am night I sat on the beach listening to it, the sleepless nights I hated the world and everything inbetween. It's everything I can't put into words. Which, Funnily enough is exactly how John describes what it means to him. It's an instrumental, and it's beautiful.",2021-01-21T11:07:30.000Z,83

AskMen,throwaway_68892188,"Men, did you ever reach a point where you realized women don't actually make you happy?","Edit: for all of the raging feminists, the title should've been \"sex doesn't make me happy\", not \"women don't make me happy\".

I (25m) spent years hooking up and have had dozens of partners. What I previously thought would manifest into an insatiable hole of sexual conquest has actually turned into the opposite.

I have grown to realize that sex is such a small fraction of my happiness. I used to seek out arm candy and now I don't even bother. What I realized matters is in the heart... beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It's mostly on the inside of us, in our brains and hearts. Pussy has grown to possess no value to me whatsoever.

I actually enjoy friendships with women in my life. I'm thankful for the heartaches and the romances that have passed. Trying to objectify women for years has actually done the complete opposite- the more I met and slept with women, the more I realized that it doesn't matter.

Sex is as desirable as eating, sleeping, or shitting. It's great for a few moments and then it ends. It's the life you live before and after that matters. There are many more satisfying things in life, filled with much more substance.

So now I am 25 and see that I am a man I would never thought I'd be. Still kinda horny, but with a different perspective.

And I'm wondering if anybody can relate.

Edit: thank you for the awards. Lots of great replies and some judgemental ones too. Thank you all for coming together in a civil way to discuss something that I think a lot of men think about! God bless you all.",2021-01-23T00:46:22.000Z,1657

AskMen,SparklingSagittarius,"What do I do when the \"I have a boyfriend\" doesn't work?","I'm asking men to get your perspective on the situation. I've had a few encounters with men who don't take \"no\" for an answer and it genuinely stresses me out. I don't want to be rude and I don't want to be sworn at for rejecting someone, but I also don't want my phone full of random numbers from men I don't know. In hopes he doesn't take it personally, my go to rejection is \"I don't give out my number\" and/or \"I have a boyfriend.\" Some men are respectful and tell me to have a great day which I love but some come at me with the \"So? We could be friends\". Or I get attitude back. I'm not a very confrontational person so I don't know how to respond and I feel uncomfortable walking away. I know I don't need to justify my answer to them... but it gives me an actual stomach ache when I get in this situation. I feel like walking away is my best answer but if any of you have any advice on how to better handle this situation I would really appreciate it.

Edit: Thank you for your feedback! It's very much appreciated.

Feminism,a_rosequartz,"The Lines of Being A \"Good\" and \"Bad\" Girl Are Blurring","While reading Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay, in one chapter, she talks about the Sweet Valley High book series. And I had an epiphany. \"I've got a lot of inner-misogyny I need to work through.\"

The series is about these two beautiful, blonde, twins, Elizabeth (the good girl), and Jessica (the bad girl). Roxane starts out by saying:

*\"Elizabeth is responsible and universally adored for her sweetness and patience. In high school, she wanted to be a journalist. She loved Todd Wilkins, a tall, handsome, and popular basketball player. She worked on the school paper and was a cheerleader -- a smart and athletic girl, the perfect combination.\"*

*\"Jessica likes boys and partying. She's charming and enjoys gossip, flirting and shopping. She loves to borrow Elizabeth's clothes and Elizabeth puts up with it because everyone gives Jessica what she wants. You cannot say no to Jessica Wakefield. She's a cheerleader too and although she comes off as a bit of an airhead, Jessica has depth and intelligence. She sometimes says unkind things but that's because she's impulsive and she has a bit of a temper. She's all emotion. Jessica is the kind of girl who gives in to her impulses while Elizabeth controls her urges, at least most of the time.\"*

Throughout the rest of the chapter, Roxane talks about how she's always liked Jessica just a little more than Elizabeth, despite Jessica being the bad twin. Then near the end of the chapter as Roxane gushes about how excited she was about reading the last book in the series was released, she writes:

*\"I don't want to give too much away but throughout the novel, we're supposed to feel sorry for Elizabeth. However, she is portrayed as such a self-indulgent, self-pitying sop of a woman you start to feel like she deserves her misery. Jessica, on the other hand, we're supposed to hate, but she's professionally successful and in a loving relationship and has a personality. She seems rational and interesting and as vibrant as ever. She makes mistakes but in a really human, endearing way.\"*

Then I set that chapter down and took a moment to drink hot tea while sitting on the sofa reeling from all the times I've been \"bad\" and not being a \"good\" girl. All the times I've wanted to voice my opinion on something but was shot down, or interrupted. All the times I've wanted to go out and have fun but \"oh no that's what bad girls do\", all the times I've announced with confidence about some goal because I'm ambitious only to be shot down again and discouraged because \"that's impossible, how about trying....\\[enter something I find completely bland and not challenging\\]...\" or just all the times I've wanted to try or learn something but I've hadn't because that's not appropriate for a lady.

Any tips for the first date with an older girl?

So I [18M] matched with this girl [20] a week ago; She was a bit hesitant at the beginning bc of my age but after a bunch of chatting and phone calls we planned for a date. 
She's really sweet and precious and I really want this to work.

We've both been single for more than a year and haven't been on dates since the lockdown.
I've neither went on a date with a girl older than me nor one that I have met purely online so this is two firsts for me.
On top of all that she's a tad above my league so I'm really nervous.
 
I'm asking you my fellow Redditors for any kind of advice or input that you think might help.

Thanks a bunch !


EDIT:

Thanks for all the recommendations. I have read all comments and the movie I have chosen tonight came from one user who has recommended a movie called Searching (2018) that got a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. I lean more towards thrillers/psychological/horror movies so this is the one I'm choosing tonight. I will let you all know how it goes when I'm done watching it !

She actually approached me about the idea of us getting intimate. I never woulda thought she like me in that way, its not all her fault as my attraction for her got the best of me and I gave in. Well we didnt last but about two weeks, little did I know she was rebounding from a break up. Anyway back to the point. She is pregnant and told me in September that I am \"probably\" the father right before she dumped me and since then she went back to her then ex and has not said two words to me. I have a terrible gut feeling she doesnt want me to have anything to do with the child if it is mine. Her sister told me she tried to convince her parents that the ex they hate is the father and the folks havent spoke to me about it at all. Ive spoke to my lawyer and he said since arent married theres not a lot I can do except add my name to a putative father registry. Im asking worse case scenario if she goes above and beyond to keep the baby from me regardless if its mine how do I deal with it for years to come?

Lately he has been even worse - constantly shoves his irrelevant opinions about covid/vaccines down other throats.
I don't even think I would invite him to my wedding because I think he would do something stupid.
Is it normal to feel this way? Can I change him to better in any way?


Could also do another post \"how to fix a brainwashed person\" but that isn't for this subreddit...",2021-01-25T20:09:42.000Z,24

AskMen,zardoz_lives,"Within the \"Dad Rock\" genre, what female artists or female led groups do you think fit in?","I saw one of the \"Now\" compilation albums called \"Now That's What I Call Dad Rock\". Most of it is pretty straight forward classic rock type stuff. Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rolling Stones, etc. There was some more modern stuff on there, like Imagine Dragons and the Lumineers. But then there were a few head scratchers there. Like Natalie Imbruglia and Avril Lavigne. 

Now, I fully believe there are some great \"dad rock\" albums by or featuring women, but IMO Natalie Imbruglia doesn't really fit the bill (no disrespect, just that she isn't \"Dad Rock\"). I can see Fleetwood Mac or Blondie on there, but I wanted to put the question to all the men out there to see who others would put on a \"dad rock\" album. No limitation to era. There are some great female led bands or solo artists out there rocking today.",2021-01-25T20:39:44.000Z,22
Feminism,homiefohlife,First climax and I learned a lot and want to thank this sub reddit,"Hello Feminism family.

As the title says I had my first actual orgasm with my husband and to be honest I was shocked on how enjoying sex (in history) was never a PARTNERSHIP rather only to get the guy off.

If sex is supposed to feel that amazing, and it is FOR BOTH parties, why is society constantly blaming women for enjoying it, when the man can enjoy it all he wants, have sex with whoever, stick it in and walk away from consequences, and when we put our foot down all hell breaks loose? 

Why is society so obsessed with a mans orgasm yet we women have to be the skilled laborers here and learn how to please them?

I just want to thank this subreddit for educating me and educating other women on loving themselves, prioritizing themselves, and being amazing individuals.

Being someone who was raised in a conservative south Asian family I was hidden away from all this. I remember being raped back in 2016 and being told I kept resisting and that’s not “hot.” 

As a survivor it took me forever to find sexual pleasure and I’m so grateful I finally found it. 

Thank you to this subreddit and intellectuals that guide women in this chaotic journey. I truly love you guys.",2021-01-25T20:40:46.000Z,6

Sitting here, I know I would not regret not getting married or not having children if that is how my life plays out.

AskMen,DragAgitated,How to stop fantasizing and obsessing over a girl who live on different country,"I'm a 20 years old male, who never had a girlfriend.

I stumble upon this girl on the internet (ig, tiktok) and i have been crushing for the last 4 months. She seems like a perfect girl.

I don't even realize until last week that i have spend many hours and days to check on her.

I couldn't stop checking on her social media to the point where i become a stalker.

My brain gets excited whenever i see an update and rush me to check it.

It torture me but when i dont get to see what she up to, i felt something is missing.

It get worse when my brain keep fantasizing and daydreaming many situations including what if situations, what if i move there, what if she has the same personality, what if there is a chance if i move there, etc.

I do have a hobby, i play games, read books, work out, but yet i somehow i find time to do all of these, maybe because i have a crush on her.

The last thing i check before sleep and the first thing i check when i wake up is her social media.

I also get jealous when she posted something with other guy.

I need help, someone to slap me with reality and stop this, but it is really hard.",2021-01-12T09:21:17.000Z,19

Feminism,RainbowStar331,[RANT] I wanna trust men and boys but they just don't let it happen.,"For a bit of background, I'm a 16 year old straight girl from Greece, so expect to be dealing with quite conservative people. DISCLAIMER: my way of speaking is exaggerated so everything I say just make it sound normal in your head, please.

So heres the tea. Since the day I entered middle school, I realised my purpose in this society had changed. I was no longer a proper child, meant to go to school and learn. My new purpose was... Giving fellow 12 year old males boners with my existence. Which obviously didn't happen, because I was FUCKING 12. I still had my squeaker voice too. I would look at my female classmates being dressed like 18 year old women just to look good for the boys while I dressed like a muslim, and still do. I'm also the type to show off my skills which I also did back then, but soon enough reality hit me. The reality that greek men hate girls with brains and only want looks. Anything I did, I was rated as a sexual object. Not a person. EVEN BY OTHER GIRLS! But middle school was just the beginning. You see, Im not conventionally attractive, a tomboy in my personality but still have feminine mannerisms, and best of all, greek men's favorite, I have tourettes syndrome. And when everyone rates your sex appeal and your sex appeal only, that kinda ruins it. I was literally verbally harrassed by a male classmate in 10th grade for having it. Funny thing is, the only reason why he had a problem with me having a CONDITION is because I don't show him what he wants to see ;) Idk if its the same anywhere else but, in greek society a woman is first a woman then uhhhh.....you get it. At least in some other cultures we are first people then women. Also the fact that these immature dickheads act like they are the default gender when biologically that's false is just amazing. Anyway, I go to a highschool, a VOCATIONAL highschool. yknow, job training, IT specialists, farmers, tourism workers ect. But it doesn't feel like highschool, let alone a vocational one. It feels like kindergarten... Especially when you consider the fact that my ass was stupid enough to choose computer science knowing damn too well how greeks react to nerdy girls... I mean, I am one to take risks. But I fucking regret it. I only have one other female classmate and the rest are male. Out of those males only ONE sees girls as people. The rest just think Im there for decor... To please THEM. like my female classmate. Who ALWAYS shows herself off like a good girl. Just how she's been taught. (My soviet parents actually taught me to develop a personality I guess...) I just feel like I cant even participate in class because everything I say is dumb because I have boobs and a vagina and DONT show it off...

Now that I'm done with my backstory, Imma get right into the meat of the deal. I feel hated by men. For no valid reason either. I'm not misandrist, I'm not some criminal. Im just...Myself. But being myself, well... Makes me not \"female enough\". Im well aware this is bullshit, but hearing that Im not my gender, made me spiral into a horrible case of gender dysphoria. Its like, Im not a girl, then I will not try to be one. I felt like transitioning was the way to get respect from others, especially men. But then my greek upbringing got in the way. I realised that Im sexually submissive. and this sub certainly knows what that means. So I thought I can't be a man because I'd be a submissive man, which my 14 year old brain thought didn' t exist. Then I saw guys acting so hypermasculine, making me feel even more unsafe. It got so bad I wanted to go to an all-girls school and just forget about all men except my dad and my uhhh... Male Comfort Character :^). yes it got so bad I did what I imagined I'd never do. Get a husbando... I want a real boyfriend but with the men I have to deal with, I dont see that happening while Im still in this country... I just feel like all men hate me because they dont find me sexually attractive. But I don't wanna be. Not being that makes me able to go out at night and go out alone. I don't tempt anyone. But Im the only one who blames these boys and their upbringing and not myself. Everyone else blames ME for not pleasing LITERAL STRANGERS I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT. Us sTuPiD girls, when we don't like someone, we just move on. But men need us to change so they like us? you have 150 other girls to choose from my guy, fuck off. While the thought of transitioning doesnt haunt me anymore, dysphoria does. I'm pissed people care so much about what I do with MY life. I look like a shopping bag with my baggy clothes, Im a little plus size. WHY DO YOU CARE? you're not me, you dony know me, not like you wanna get to know me. I can't go to school, I can't go to my town's square, I can't go to downtown. Why? Because Im not pretty and female enough. I may be a bottom but I won't be one with a stranger to please his boner. No! But I'M the one who should change. Not men. Me. I got rejected by men from day one. Before they even gave me a chance, and women went along with it. They went ahead and blamed me. And all those abuse stories I hear dont make it any better. What if a guy hooks up with me just to rape me? Like my friend's ex did to her which made her not wanna date again. If that happens to me, I will just kill myself. I will not be blamed for a horny guy's \"curiosity\". But at the same time,... I wanna fall in love with a guy. have at least ONE guy who loves me. Who I will WANT to please, and who will please me. My father is not enough. But  I don't wanna talk to guys... They fucking scare me. I hate them... If I could commit assault against a guy and not go to jail I fucking would. I can't stand them anymore. I've had it to here with male entitlement and female surrender. There will come a time when I will reach my limit. I have dreams but I doubt I'll be able to accomplish them as a filthy wOmAn...

I would stop with the suggestions altogether, but it seems like if I stop, the things I'm suggesting will likely never get done, and I can't really do things like check someone else's email for them.

AskMen,InnerHeart6,Men of Reddit: How to reassure someone insecure about BBC stereotypes and other racial tropes?,"Looking for some advice on this, I have been seeing someone for a while now and its going really well, we met on a dating app and before we met up for our first date, he told me on the phone that he has a small penis and that a lot of girls go for him because of the assumption that he has a big penis just because of his ethnicity. He struggles a lot with confidence when we have sex, he did mention that the bbc expectation makes it harder for him to feel comfortable initially. I have had multiple discussions with him where i have said penis size has never been an issue no matter the person, and I like him because of his character and our connection. I know confidence in the bedroom is a universal issue, no matter where we are in the world, I just would like some advice in how to reassure him that I'm not dating him because of these fetishised ideas of black men. 

I have also dated people in the past who have had experiences with girls objectifying and fetishising them (grabbing their penis in a club before introducing themselves, asking about penis size as if they were asking for their name, and just overall getting negative sexual attention). When they have spoken to me about it, they have mentioned that they were mainly white girls. I know me being white doesn't automatically mean I embrace these incredibly racist stereotypes, but im not sure how to approach it next time he talks to me because i know its a sensitive topic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be incredible!",2021-01-17T07:26:12.000Z,139

The men appeared uncertain about how to answer. Then a former once-a-week buyer, arrested for attempting to purchase sex from a police officer posing as a 15-year-old girl, said, “I don’t want to know how the sausage is made.”

A piece of meat. A commodity to be consumed.

Not a child. Not a life.”

So I asked him what intimacy means to him and he said like, closeness - but couldn't describe what he actually meant. So he asked me what intimacy means to me, so I said:

Intimacy to me is a romantic relationship. Being intimate with someone means to be vulnerable with them, and comfortable and share your inner deepest thoughts and feelings, and to have those feelings understood and reciprocated. Feeling safe and secure with them. 

I also talked about sex. Sex can be instinctive (his words) and I said but making love as lame as it sounds, is ultimate intimacy. It's making love with someone that you feel close with, secure, and you love them for them and love being with them, want to be with them.

Feminism,safenue,Taking action! An app working to improve women’s safety in cities.,"Hi girls,

I'm Tulay from Turkey. Women safety is a serious problem in Turkey like most parts of the world. So, i try to change something. I want to develop an app, a location-based woman-only anonymous social network. I want to successfully combine a social network and location-based safety app. That is best I can do for now and it should greatly reduce the harassment of women.

Would you use an app like this? I make a prototype for android and create a crowdfunding campaign.

So if you have any tips, please post them here or mail it: [safenue@gmail.com](mailto:safenue@gmail.com)

And finally my fundraising page, take a look and tell me your opinions : [https://fundrazr.com/41kPd9?ref=tw\\_c9lnG8](https://fundrazr.com/41kPd9?ref=tw_c9lnG8)

AskMen,Tizunia,What's something that your S/O did that made you realize you could fall for them?,"I think we all need  a little bit of a positive talk :3

Also I just wanted to just talk about my beautiful wife and how fucking great she is and hearing other stories like that might give people that nice feeling and I'm kinda drunk so I might regret this in the morning lol

But the first time I knew I could fall for my wife was when we were at senior prom and she was dancing like no one else could see her, she literally didn't give a fuck and it was so cute to just see her, kinda weird ngl, dancing. I was going through a rough time after a girl I loved led me on for ages and lied to me before getting with someone else and rubbing it in my face, so this was the first time I felt happy just watching her dance. She pulled me onto the dance floor with her when the next song began and my heart fucking just skipped a beat and it was so weird because she was my childhood friend since forever and I didn't think I'd see her that way but I did and now we're married and we have a beautiful new baby and I'm so happy",2021-01-15T05:22:46.000Z,108

AskMen,a_lucid_casadilla,How important is chemistry in a relationship?,"I’ve been single for a while now and am starting to think I’m way too analytical about my potential SOs. To me, conversation should be engaging and come naturally in a romantic partner. I think chemistry would be related to this, as body language, eye contact, touching etc would follow. 

Obviously every one has different priorities, but I’ve realized that this is one of mine. My question to you is, to what extent is it okay to write someone off because you “have no chemistry”? 

I’m seeing someone that I like being around for many reasons, but I’m starting to realize that we don’t have a lot in common, and don’t have a lot of chemistry. While we can both maintain a conversation, that could be because we are both adults and know how to do so. I’m finding that I’m not really engaged in these conversations, and often forget/tune out when she responds (lol I know this is bad). 

To what degree is this just me being a bad listener? Should I just be a better listener and try to make it work? I’m having a hard time quantifying the value of “chemistry” and am hesitant to write her off just because “we don’t have chemistry”.",2021-01-17T20:47:43.000Z,18

I don't think I've ever heard any guy using that term or anything similar. As a matter of fact, the closest thing I've seen any guys do anything similar is by playing video games. Is it just different stress tolerances between the genders? How do y'all\"destress\" and what is y'all's tolerance levels?

EDIT: even though there are only a few responses I noticed a pattern of either doing nothing or doing something with your hands instead of \"pampering\" yourself which is super interesting.

I have difficulties being \"sexy\" or \"hot\" around people, especially women. I will say that I have been called sexy by other people but even though I admit I am attractive, I do not \"feel\" it or know how to act like it and become it.

I suffer from social anxiety which I take medication for and I have had childhood abuse (sexual and mental) which made me very confused when it comes to my sexuality and I have acted out with men due to my past.

I did not date in high school and I am not very certain how to flirt or show interest with women even if I'm considered attractive. It's something I have struggled for some time now.

I rent a room from him that I found on craigslist.

Anyway, we’re like complete opposites in the “life journey” sense. I’ve had to literally learn how to come up in life, and I’m still struggling, lol. Anyway, I’m physically fit, I cook, and just... go to work... you know... do life. 

It’s not big stuff but it’s like he create all these little obstacles around the house to make things just a LITTLE bit harder for me to live there. Like when I cook, he crowds up the kitchen counter top with different things or he’ll crowd up the dining table. When I use the laundry room, it gets crowded up outta nowhere in between loads.

When I moved in, he said I could use the benchpress in the garage. Sure enough, he ripped the whole fucking thing out and sold it. That’s another thing... he’s like an Indian giver. Cool one second... but really... he’s just... not... cool... man. 

Anyway, I’m so annoyed by it all at this point. I did research on how to deal with haters but the problem with the research is that it doesn’t talk about if you actually LIVE with the person. I’m just looking for something... anything at this point... advice would be greatly appreciated

Feminism,[deleted],Can you still call yourself a feminist if you give in to a conservative family?,"I am from a south asian household and one of the most significant way patriarchy is enforced is, a man always accompanies me when I am traveling for hours in a rented car. Though I put up a fight, they barely listen and I am left with no other choice but to be okay with having a man traveling with me \"for my safety\" and no, they never trust the driver enough. My ex partner said if I really was a feminist I would have found alternative ways to travel and wouldn't have relied on them even if that will ensue extreme drama and family tension and inconvenience on my behalf. On the side note, I am always calling out my family for their sexist remarks and instill my opinions through rigourous debates, sometimes which turn to be fruitful.

AskMen,Soulfire328,"Men, why will you get what your GF wants you to get when its not what you want or not what is best for you?","Ok so I need to explain a little. I work in retail, namely a store that sells out door recreation equipment. I sell hiking boots, hiking shoes, running shoes etc. Now in my time here I have learned way more about feet and shoes than I think I ever cared to. I additionally am wilderness first aid certified. Basically the long and short of that is that I know just how many ways you can royally screw yourself up while outside if your not careful.  

&amp;#x200B;

This then segways to me selling shoes/boots.  Generally a young couple will come in looking to get some gear to go do something together. They come to be get fitted for hiking boots. I ask where they are going, what the plan to do etc, in order to get what I think is going to work best for them. I could wax poetic about the need for ankle support when backpacking, proper arch support for your feat and what not but we would be here all day, the gist is that I do my best to make sure the people the come to me will be as safe as possible. If however the boots I pick are appealing for what ever reasons to the mans girlfriend she will keep point at the one she likes on him or keep insisting he trys this other one on. He will ask to try it on and I oblige but explain how these boots/shoes are not meant for what they are doing/ how his chances of being injured significantly increase with this pair. Generally when this happens that will be the pair he walks out with, even if he says he doesn't totally like the way they feel. Why risk your own health just because someone else likes they way they look? I mean if your two days out and someone is out their judging you based on your shoes...well I think that might indicate you probably shouldn't care what the persons opinion is. Also should stress that its not like this happens constanlty. Only seen it a few times but still I wonder.",2021-01-02T02:52:23.000Z,17

AskMen,omgdetmads,"How do you cope with the woman you are in love with and you, due to carrer choices, arent meant to be?","Me and my gf broke up when she left to join the fire corp in my region, due to her living at the fire barracks during the 9 months of her training. I was more reluctant to let go, and wanted to see if we could get things to work in the weekends, but she felt like it was too big of a change to give it a try. 

The first 3 months we saw eachother 3 times, and all she could talk about was how awsome the fire corp is, and i told her i was happy for her, but our talks seemed very friendly and shallow, and things seemed like we were just going to be friends, even dough we cudled and there was some minor sexual tension. 

Then the next time she reached out, she said she missed me alot and hoped to see me soon, and when we did, we ended up kissing. She then said she regretted it a bit, since she still felt like there wasnt space for us in her life still, and nothing more happend.

Then a month went by, and new years came around, and she called me the day before to let me know she missed me alot, and felt like we were growing apart. Randomly we were going to be close to eachother on new years eve, and we ended up texting and flirting all day like we were back together, and when we met up, we kissed alot and when for a nice romantic walk. We agreed that she would come and wake me up the next day to chill trough the hangover.

When she came to my place, she started again nonstop talking about the fire corp, and it felt like she pulled away from me again and back to the fire corp, and we talked again about that there just wasnt space for us in her life since she was leaving for the fire corp again next day.

How do you cope with knowing that there deffintly is a spark between you if things go right, but that its just not meant to be, atleast for right now and some time?

So I am currently in a predicament where I am in this internal battle of my head vs. my heart as I am still trying to get over someone. I thought initially that I was as I've learned a lot about myself, but my heart has been speaking otherwise. In my head I keep thinking: \"They weren't good for you, they had problems before, they don't know what they want, etc.\" My heart thinks: \"I want to be there for them, I want to keep trying, I want to be better for that person.\" This is something I haven't been fully understanding of myself and was curious if anyone else has dealt with this predicament?

Wall of text...

There was an opportunity to develop a project at work 2 years ago. It was around customer orders and making sure they went smoothly. Myself and someone else (she is part-time) were successful in securing the position.

I took the initial idea and plans and changed them so the project would work more efficiently. Eventually the person who started the project moved on and we continued.There were ups and downs as you'd expect but overall it was working well.

Once COVID hit the office closed down and we were assigned to another, under a new manager. She seemed pretty good and did help to support us, her 1-up kept fairly hands-off which was good.

Something I should note is that this other person and I have been working from home since March last year. I've really enjoyed this because after 7 years I don't have to travel 1.5 hours each way to get to the work.

I took just over 3 weeks leave in July (I think) for school holidays to take care of the kids. Prior to this we were told that another team would be started (no date was advised) and that would mean more orders sent to us. I was fine with it but I said that we would need more people to manage the work.

I went on leave a couple of weeks after that and that team started sending their work a few days later.

I came back to find that the other person did about a weeks worth of work and then just stopped. It took over a month to catch up, after getting 2 more full-time people onboard.

We were able to keep these extra people on until Christmas when one had to leave permanently and the other temporarily for a month.

I had a meeting with my manager and her 1-up. He asked why there was such a huge backlog. I explained that when I went on leave we were 100% up to date and that I wasn't involved, my manager supported me in that. I also said that I advised them that we'd need more people for the extra work. In this meeting they also said that in the new year they'll be looking at bringing people back into the office.

I took about 2 weeks off over Christmas/New Year. When I came back I found that the work was 2-3 days behind which is within an acceptable margin. I was back for about a week and a half and we were able to keep it at this level with the reduced number of people. I then another few days and the work blew out to over a week backlog.

We're still trying to get up to date but we have 1 person coming back in Feb that will definitely help.

I had another meeting my manager and her 1-up on Thursday afternoon. They said they want everyone back in the office next Wednesday. I said that I would be happy to come in Wed-Fri next week as my wife is on leave (she started working again full-time partway through the year) but with school, and my wife, going back the week after I couldn't commit to coming in because it was such short notice and I'll have to organise something. They weren't impressed with this; \"well we did tell you last year\".

I expressed my disappointment that everytime I went on leave it all went downhill and that I couldn't do the up and down like that anymore, especially when I advise them of my leave months in advance and that we are constantly in need of more people. They said that they agreed 100% with my points. They insisted that getting everyone into the office would help with the workload. This is not something that I can see it helping with.

I came into this project knowing I didn't want to make it a permanent move. I planned on getting it to the point where it can stand up on it's own and then move on. It's at that point now (with enough people on deck) and it's no longer a challenge for me.

**Now the questions...**

**1 - How can I be assertive and say that coming into the office everyday is not realistic for me anymore with my wife working full-time now as well.** 

I've also discovered a solid work/life balance by working from home. Something I was severely missing leaving home at 6:30am and returning at 6pm Mon-Fri. Last year I said that I was happy to do 1, maybe 2, days a week in the office when things got back to normal.

**2 - How do I get them to understand that by getting more people on permanently it will help with the workload so there is less stress on us, we can spend more quality time with orders/customers and that would in turn improve the results**",2021-01-24T00:02:54.000Z,7

AskMen,kitesaredope,How do I manage my newfound long quarantine hair?,"Hey all. I hope this finds you well. I figured I’d ask this question here because googling this question and having to read answers like “When growing out your hair, it’s best to do a drive by with your stylist every few weeks. Give him so creative control.” [I literally read that here](https://www.themanual.com/grooming/long-hair-men-guide/) just seemed like bullshit. It seems like every time I read up on “How do I take care of the (insert thing)” GQ and others interpret it as “How do I make this my new hobby?”

Look, I’m not looking to make this hair a replacement for my personality. I’m trying to not go out. Barbershops are closed. My wife is a nurse. As a guy, I’m trying to do my part and not get sick or get anyone else sick. It’s my civic responsibility.  

But my hair is like 5 inches long now. I used to like it scissor cut short, brushed to my left side (Think standard little boy haircut, 30 years later). But now it goes down to the brim of my nose. It curls around my ears, its down my neck. It’s a whole surfer dude doo. So how do I take care of it until I can get it cut? How do I keep it from getting in my face all the time? What products do you use? Do you like them? I figured if I’m here, I might embrace the long hair lifestyle for a bit. 

Can anyone point me in the right direction so I don’t have to keep reading these god awful “Manly Man” articles? Thanks for your time.

AskMen,Cpt-Dreamer,"What’s the best way to deal with people who are ill-mannered, disrespectful, who go out of their way to give you shit without reason?","I am quite a soft spoken guy, polite and don’t deal with confrontation very well. Even if someone is trying to antagonise me I’ll usually just keep quiet and respond politely. I find if I respond negatively and insult back I lose the verbal spar or say something stupid. Generally, I’ll avoid these people but if I can’t, what’s the best way to handle it? Being too quiet can sometimes look weak. I try not to take these situations personally either but if the provocateur becomes persistent the situation becomes more complicated to handle. I then go into myself and overthink. I find when a woman is the one provoking me it’s even tougher to puzzle through because people jump to her aid when I defend myself.

AskMen,galliumOSuser17,"Older Men, How Did You Stop Working So Hard?","I'm in my mid-thirties, stable job, stable life really, but I am trying to figure out how I will navigate the next 30 years of my career. Work stress is a big problem for me. I often can't sleep and find myself unable to disconnect mentally from work. Throughout several jobs at different companies, I have felt like I am working harder than my coworkers and I am not recognized or compensated for it. I see other people chatting, laughing, going to meetings where nothing important happens, and getting to work from home, all while I am rushing to meet deadlines and I feel like I am doing other departments' work.

**Older men of Reddit who used to work too hard, how did you change your habits or your relationship with work to get to a better place?**

\"Maybe it's you, galliumOSuser17.\" Absolutely. Maybe it's a boundaries thing- maybe I need to say No more often. \"No, that sounds like the responsibility of such-and-such department.\" \"No, I can't meet that deadline.\" \"No, your project is not my only project and I can't prioritize your project for at least another six weeks.\" I guess I could do that, but we're pushed so hard to do more with less in my company. My department is also made entirely of men and I feel like there's a really big nose-to-the-grindstone mentality. I am also certain that managers get bonuses for completing more projects with lower headcount, which is why they won't hire more staff.

Maybe it's a poor choice of career? I've worked in \"logic-y\" stuff, stuff like data analytics and IT hardware. Maybe this is an instance where the people in charge don't really get it, or maybe I'm not making my job and my explanations accessible enough? But I really feel like I am preparing for and cleaning up after the Sales department parties. Like, I do all the heavy lifting, but I don't see any of the bonuses or parties. The one dinner I got invited to for an event I did way too much work for, I was not thanked in a long list of people who were thanked.

In my mid twenties I was an assistant teacher and I loved it. Sometimes I think about getting a teaching license. Sometimes I think about just finding another job that seems more fun.

Older guys who can relate to me, what did you change to have a better work life? Yourself? Your job?

Feminism,Camlea20,‘Men who hate women’ - Laura Bates 2020 - Has anyone read it?,"TW discussion of online forums within the manosphere with calls for extreme violence against women and descriptions of terror attacks.

Is anyone else reading this or has anyone else read this book? If so what are your thoughts?

Or if you haven’t read the book; what are your thoughts generally on the ‘manosphere’ and the risks they pose? Or the media and governments response to these issues?

I think quite possibly it’s one of the most important books written recently. Exposing men who hate women. An issue that desperately needed to be highlighted for so long.

It’s a terrifying eye opener to the extreme online misogyny of Incels, PUAs, ‘so called’ Men’s rights activists and MGTOW which is rarely taken seriously but so often manifests within the ‘real world’ as violence against women and terrorism.

It’s an uncomfortable read but an important one!
It highlights the links between these groups and the Alt-right as well as the misogynistic and orchestrated attack on female politicians, journalists and quite frankly any woman who dares to have an opinion.

It shines a light on the sexual harassment and violence promoted by some in the PUA industry by so-called gurus’ who advocate for the legalisation of rape on private property. With certain PUA forum users feeling completely comfortable to comment things such as:

‘If they reject me I grope them…I assault them because they deserve it and I take back what is mine and I don’t care about anything other than my own needs’

It highlights commonly held views of the manosphere about female inferiority. Laura stumbles upon one particular thread entitled ‘should women be considered human’ the general consensus was no because women are all whores!

Casually calling for violence and rape. There are a section of Incels called rapecells (I did not know this) both groups frequently debate which type of women would make ideal sex slaves and talk about Roasties who are women who according to them have ‘too’ much sex and as a result have deformed Labia’s.

‘talking female slaves has always been a normal part of human history’

This book brings attention to the misogynistic terrorist attacks (12 are listed) between 2009 and the present day by men openly affiliated with online Incel groups alone!

Though the media has consistently failed to report the motivations of such attacks unlike other types of terrorism referring to the men who commit them simply as ‘lone-wolves’ or mentally ill.

Few links are drawn between the attackers themselves or the ideologies they adhere to. Despite the fact most of the terrorists drew links themselves! Many of them ‘hailed’ the misogynistic terrorists that went before them and all either explicitly explained their motivations as a hatred of women or were active members of online misogynistic groups.

They left ‘manifestos’ or suicide notes saying things such as:

‘The ultimate evil behind sexuality is the human female…they think like beasts and in truth they are beasts’

‘ I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck up blonde slut’

‘I will be a god punishing women from their depravity… I cannot kill every single female on earth but I can deliver a devistating blow which will shake all of them to the core of their wicked hearts’

3 quotes curtesy of Elliot Rodger 2014

He went on to kill 6 and injure 14 in a terrorist attack.

Or

Ben Moynihan in 2014 (the same year) who attempted to stab 3 women to death in Portsmouth. Before he wrote:

‘I think every girl is a type of slut, they don’t give boys like us a chance’

Or

George Sodini in 2009 who walked into an LA fitness turned the lights off and started firing bullets into a group of women taking an aerobics class because women wouldn’t give him sex. He had links to an online pickup artist community and was directly linked fo Incels.

In a world where views like this are commonly espoused it is unsurprising real acts of violence and terror are committed against women.

with MGTOW forums commonly discussing false rape allegations and making outrageous statements like:

‘we do not know how many false accusations there are. They could be the majority’

Or views like this:

‘Women are out of control and have been for a very long time’

or

‘so-called’ Men’s rights Activists who frequently suggest on ‘A voice for men’ that women are intellectually inept:

‘pussy is the only real empowerment women will ever know…wishful thinking of feminist ideology aside, what remains is the fact that it is men and pretty much men only who draw power from accomplishment, who invent technology, build nations, cure disease, create empires and generally advance civilisation’

Does anyone have any views on these groups and the danger they pose? Or why the media and governments have been so silent on the issue?

I grew up brutally suppressing my feelings and it's only been in the last year or two, as I've quit gaming (which is how I suppressed) that I've started feeling more.

It's gone well in most ways- I definitely feel more, and I'm more engaged with the world. But also, feelings are really hard. Especially with anger, rage, and lust, all the things I used to suppress are coming out of the woodwork. I think, eventually, I will learn how to cope and navigate all these feelings better (since before, my main tactics were repression and avoidance). But it is suuuper awkward now.

18(M) I know this is going to be a fairly long post so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and give me some advice. 

I went through a pretty nasty breakup in October 2019 that shattered me. She cheated on me and I even had it on video. Though, I discovered it wasn’t the first time after we broke up. From that point forward, I was destroying myself but masking it as “living free” and just “having fun”. Smoking too much weed, addicted to disposable vapes, (I had already been addicted since I was 15 but still destroying myself nonetheless) and taking acid multiple times a month. I figured it was the only way to cope, to show me having a grand ol’ time on social media to show everyone that this breakup has not taken a toll on me even though it definitely had and was the main reason for my abuse in substances. This stayed this way until about April 2020.

When quarantine struck, I was forced to be at home with nothing but my thoughts. Eventually, one way or another, I turned to Christianity. From April to October 2020 I had been back and forth on the substances. Some days/weeks I’d stay completely sober, some days/weeks I’d have binge smoking. I was clearly on the path to trying to become a better me and get sober. On Halloween 2020 I took my last tab of acid and my last hits of nicotine. I have not gone back since. However this break up still takes a toll on me from time to time. Sometimes my mind will say that she will turn around and end up a good person who shares the same morals as me and we’ll somehow end up together. Sometimes my mind wins that argument and I check how she is doing on social media to find that she has nothing posted. Which didn’t help the compulsion to know if she was developing moral and not intoxicating herself and sleeping around. I am left with no answer. Still, even through all that writing, the break up isn’t the point of this post. 

Seriously, if your still reading, I love you. 

I got a job about 2 months ago from a very attractive female friend. Blonde and stunning. Aside from talking about work and school, we flirt sometimes. However she posts on social media all the time of her being fucked up and “living life” (ironic) and smoking and drinking and just having a grand ol’ time. I can tell she has taken a liking to me and me to her as well. Here’s the big issue: She’s throwing a huge party in the downtown area of my city and has rented out a place for her and her friends to stay at for a couple days and invited me to sleepover. Now, if I told that sentence to anyone without context, they’d call me stupid for saying that I have an issue with a super hot blonde asking me to stay over at a downtown penthouse for 3 nights. Because of my development and what I’ve gone through, I feel like it is a problem. I don’t want to slip back into my old ways. Even the thought of smoking or drinking and all of those this brings me disgust because I’ve fought so hard to defeat those demons and still are trying to keep them under today. My dilemma is missing out on a party that could I could potentially remember forever, or keep my progress going in my slow and dull life. 

A part of me says “well, you should go not only because you might get some action, but you could possibly meet some pretty cool people”. Another part of me says “the people you want to be with and associate yourself with won’t be at an event like this where everyone is fucked up, plus all the hard work you’ve put in” Am I restricting myself too much from having some high school fun? Or should I continue on my path of discovery and keep doing what I’m doing?",2021-01-20T01:02:50.000Z,4

I have horrible feet due to being a runner for the past 6 years. I don’t know how to describe what I have. I don’t want to describe everything in detail. Let’s just say I want to improve my toe nails.

I’ve always been envy on girls who can show there feet and they’re all perfect and clean. I see very few guys that have good  foot hygiene. I really believe guys should never wear sandals cause they don’t take care of there feet.

Any tips to improve your feet. I been told maybe I should visit a foot spa to get my nails clean and done. How do guys find a nail salon. 

Any habits or daily you guys do to take care of your feet

Thank you in advance.",2021-01-01T16:32:29.000Z,16

Feminism,robbieracks,Is using a woman as a muse wrong?,"New to this sub, and hoping this belongs here...

Typically, a muse is used for visual art (painting, portraiture, etc.). However, I myself as both a cis-hetero male and a songwriter have habit of writing a lot of love songs. Most of the time I write from past relationships, but gather inspiration from other sources like nature, film, fashion, drugs, or even Instagram. 

I recall once seeing a gorgeously shot picture of a beautiful woman on Instagram, and it served as inspiration for a song that I wrote. I felt my intentions were pure and the art “felt right,” but in the back of my mind I felt a sense of guilt for possibly unknowingly objectifying this woman as an aesthetically pleasing muse for my work.

One other instance I can recall is when I wrote a poem called “America, the Beautiful” where I personified America as a woman with disdain toward her appealing facade of “Liberty and Justice for all!” when her actions and interior were abhorrent and distasteful. Despite the message being clear, I felt odd being a male putting these negative attributes onto a woman—a few of my female poet friends said it wasn’t a big deal to them, but it’s again this lingering guilt that sets in.

I guess what I’m asking is, where is the line to be drawn between art, beauty, and objectification? Is this even objectification, or something else entirely? If it is still objectification? Is objectification always wrong?",2021-01-11T19:00:24.000Z,4

If a girl is responding well and is creating conversation it's easy but when I approach a girls and it's up to me to start the conversation my mind goes blank.

AskMen,doddlido,"Boyfriend uncomfortable with the way I dress, how do I make him comfortable?","So me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years and there is one topic in our relationship that keeps coming up and we have a hard time moving past it. Its about the clothes I wear.

Background:
We both grew up in religious and cultured households and we both \"broke free\" and don't agree with many things in the religion.
In the religion modesty is important and me being a little rebel, this was the first thing I rebelled against! I started wearing clothes I like and that fit my body type and yes that involves tight clothes where you can see my figure or tanktops or overtheknee dresses and skirts. And while I don't wear things that are too revealing/daring from a western perspective, I'm basically naked from our culture's perspective. 

The problem: 
My bf keeps having this inner battle every time I wear something that is considered too tight or revealing. He says he really wants me to decide what to wear and that it's my decision but that it makes him really uncomfortable. And the thing that makes him most uncomfortable is when other guys check me out when I'm with him. 

The question:
I really wanna help him to not have these inner battles where he is torn between two sides, but I have no idea how to ease his discomfort other than to start dressing like he wants me to. How can I help him?",2021-01-06T11:44:18.000Z,140

AskMen,shut-up-politics,Is it embarrassing to ask why a date didn't go well?,"I had a first date a couple weeks ago. Few hours, coffee shop, wandered round a book shop. It went well, I thought. We went out again last Sunday for a walk round a park (thanks lockdown). Now, the conversation was pretty good and I thought we got along well. At the end I suggested meeting up again and she said just as friends. So, that sucked. 

I've been mulling over exactly what went wrong on that date. It could easily be that she just wasn't feeling it, and that's absolutely fine. However, there was one incident where I'm not sure if she picked up on my sarcasm. She asked if people reacted to the pandemic how I thought and I quite sarcastically said \"oh yeah, all the sheeple with their masks\". 

Now, I've got a pretty monotone voice and people don't often pick up on my sarcasm. And she moved the conversation rapidly, didn't acknowledge what I said, and I did quickly think \"I hope she realised that was sarcasm\". 

I'm just now slightly neurotic that I've inadvertently made myself appear to be an anti-mask mental person and completely sabotaged the date. I kinda want to message her and find out, even though I'm 80% sure she'll just say it wasn't that and she just doesn't like me. In a way, I think I'd prefer knowing that instead of wondering if I fucked it up.

So usually I'll get a towel and wipe her down or she'll go to the bathroom to clean up. But several times she'll just roll over and get it all over the sheets. This is her bed and she always washes the sheets the next day. 

What do you think about that? Anyone else experience this?

It kinda bothered me at first but as long as I'm not in the wet spot or scraping my knee against it the next day I just accept it. And she likes cuddling the whole time instead of getting out of bed which is nice.",2021-01-23T17:49:10.000Z,10

She was all around nice, good to talk to, attractive, etc. What really turned me off about her, however, was that she didn't really seem to have much direction where she wanted to take her life and just seemed to be comfortable in her current situation. 

For reference, she's a receptionist that currently lives with her mother. When I asked about the living situation, it wasn't due to some financial hardships in her or her mother's part or was in between careers, it was just because the rent was cheap. To me that was off putting for the reasons above.

I am, by nature, sensible, not particularly promiscuous, in touch with my feminine side and loud. Even thou I'm straight, most people think I'm gay. This is partly because my mom was more of a role model than my dad.

I do know that I have many great things about my personality, like being charming and highly social, however, after almost 2 years of therapy I reached the conclusion that my romantic and sexual life has been totally sabotaged by myself, because I still condemn myself for not being the classic Macho Latino.

AskMen,Mark_Tischer,How do I prepare for cowardly attacks?,"I have this happen all the time to me just slightly different in how it's done: the sniper approach.

1. So I am walking down the street, it's snowing. All of a sudden a snowball hits me from behind. I turn around and I see nobody. Or I see a group of people who claim to have done nothing. Even if I knew there was a guy in this group who did it, they won't tell me.
2. I am playing paintball. All of a sudden I get shot, I don't see anybody, who did it. Of course, in paintball it's the goal, so I know others are not mean intended. It's all in good fun. But it's the same principle.
3. I am at home, someone rings, I go to the door and nobody is there.
4. I am going to a date, the woman doesn't show up. Later I hear that she and her friends were driving past me in their car and never intended to meet. Her number was not available anymore.
5. I get change by a taxi driver. Later I realize he gave me much less back. I have no license plate and he would not admit it anyways.
6. And many other similar situations.

I am attacked in a sneaky way and I don't know who did it, and \"nobody saw anything\".

Especially the \"nobody saw anything\" makes me more angry than the attack.

I am in a situation and others exploit it to do damage to me. They don't even think twice.

I am aware of my surroundings mind you. But I don't have eyes in my back.

How do I handle those moments without getting paranoid?

In other words:

1. How do I spot weaknesses in myself that make me an \"easy target\" without getting paranoid?
2. How do I figure out who attacked me?

Any advice is useful, no matter how immoral it is, as long as it MEETS THE END. If it doesn't, I will ignore your post.",2021-01-17T00:25:01.000Z,35

AskWomen,lizzward,What’s your go-to “I can barely be bothered to cook but I need to eat something” depression meal?,"Edit: that’s a lot of notifications! Good to see we’re mostly all managing to keep ourselves fed and hydrated one way or another 💙

Edit 2: I've seen a few people say they're saving this post, which is amazing! I didn't expect this response at all!  

I thought it might be helpful to put a little list of some common answers/easy meals here that I've seen if anyone's struggling and needs something minimum effort...

1) Meal replacement shakes/protein shakes/smoothies/tinned soup  
Super quick, gets some nutrients in, ultimate minimum effort! 

2) Beans on toast! 
A UK staple/easy meal of champions.  Add cheese (and Worcestershire sauce/hot sauce) if you're feeling up to it! 

3) Double up cooking when you're feeling good! 
Stick those extra portions in the freezer and just whack 'em in the microwave

4) Easy quesadilla!  
Two tortilla wraps with some cheese (and whatever else you fancy) in the middle, stick it in the microwave and you're good to go

5) Peanut butter.  
On a fork, on a spoon, on an apple, in a PBJ sandwich, added to a protein shake....just, peanut butter. 

6) Fried rice.  
I saw a great tip (not sure who from, sorry, but I'll try and find it!) who recommended ordering some extra portions of rice in a takeaway because it's quick and easy!

7) Pasta!  Cook loads at once if you need to. Add pesto, or a jar of sauce, or a tin of tuna, or just some cheese. Whatever you have.

8) Cereal

9) Eggs
Easy to boil, peel and eat. Better than nothing!",2021-01-17T00:35:34.000Z,1860

I, soon to turn 26 in a few months wanted to ask fellow brothers over here to help me out. A little back story, I broke up with my serious ex-girlfriend in mid 2019. The relationship was so awful and the breakup wasn't easy either but managed to pull through and come back stronger. I've been single ever since, I've dated a few women but absolutely nothing serious and just physical.

Lately I see lot of my friends getting married and settling which got me thinking a lot almost everyday. This year, I set few goals for myself in terms of career and to gain muscle(I'm skinny) so that I can learn boxing. I do like my space but I am debating myself whether it's the time for me to get into a serious relationship!! Because career goal for me in this and next year would be pivotal but the loneliness and seeing all my friends getting married got me thinking hella lots. And so many people often telling me that if I don't find someone now then all I'm gonna be left with is single moms or divorcees and constantly on my ass about settling down. I tried balancing both before but it just never worked out for me honestly.

So I just wanted to know if anyone can advice me into what to do?",2021-01-19T23:01:07.000Z,9

AskMen,SunView4545,How do you manage the American work culture and a desk job?,"I've been remote for a while during the pandemic, but here and there I'll return to the office for meetings, etc as its optional. Kind of nice to change it up.

Since returning, I noticed, many of my co-workers don't even take lunch breaks, get up to stretch or anything..they just seem content sitting there all day, every day. 

How do people do it? They get down to the desk earlier and stay later than I can..

Given the American work culture, we're rewarded for the more we work..I consistently feel like I'm cutting my day short even though I leave after an honest 8 - 8.5 hours..

Its not like we have an amazing work life balance / benefits/ vacation policy either..

I hear people in silicon valley, tech start ups, etc work crazy hours behind a computer.

AskMen,EdirX,How do you guys find jobs at this day and age?,"Hello reddit, I'm a 24 year old guy who just got a bachelor's degree in art and design in July of last year.
Ever since then I started updating my curriculum, linkedin and indeed, trying to get a job, i didn't think it would be hard since I have many friends who didn't even finish high school and have a decent job that gets them a good salary.

So at first I wanted to find literally ANY job that paid, since I have 0 work experience, just studied my entire life, so i literally sent my CV to any listing i found. 2 months go by and i got 0 call backs.

So i changed my attitude, updated my linkedin and cv again to fit what i actually would like to do, (design, modeling, animation) and tried again, sent my stuff on every site and every listing, and STILL no one contacts me, so now I'm pretty desperate. Is it the current state of the world or am I just doing something wrong?

TL;DR: i have 0 work experience, applying for jobs that I'm not qualified for is inconsequential and applying for jobs that I'm qualified for is useless because they ask for 2-3 years of experience.",2021-01-17T01:36:26.000Z,44

AskMen,FrostFiniti,"Men of Reddit, How do you make time for yourself when it seems like work takes all of it?","I’m (22M) currently working on a rig for a water well drilling company.  It consists of 12 hour shifts with usually one weekend off a month (2 if I’m lucky).  I’m currently on the night shift which starts at 5PM and ends at 5AM with a 40 minute commute to the rig location.  And typically the weekends I DO get off are spent in a different city while I complete my monthly scheduled military drill for the National Guard.

Typically I get home around 5:40AM, take a quick shower and am usually asleep by 6:30AM.  I wake up at about 1PM and get ready for work until about 2:00PM which leaves me about 2 hours of time to myself.  

Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love my job and I enjoy everything about it.  I’m really just trying to make a future for myself.  But i’ve worked about 3 weeks non stop with no weekends yet and I’m feelin a little worn out.  So my question is how do you take time for yourself when it literally feels like you have no life outside of work?",2021-01-11T04:28:41.000Z,15

AskMen,AndekeX,How do I know when to listen to my gf and admit I'm wrong and when to hold my ground?,"Honestly, I'm having such a hard time knowing when to be like \"okay, I'm wrong\", and when not to. I end up not really doing it alot, and it makes me insecure, but i also really never see how I'm wrong. Like i digg really deep and spend so much time and energy on considering where I'm in the wrong, but honest to all the gods, i can't really find it. It can be everything from small disagreements to high fights. I just always find her perspective and arguments to be so obscure and taken from nothing.

I'm stuck thinking I'm either a manipulative ashole, or my gf is just simply not right most of the time. I feel like a complete idiot beacuse this is a classic stereotype i guess, but i don't feel like I'm a person who just is right all the time. In most other relations in my life, this is not the case at all! I'm a very curious type who like to explore the world and people in all ways and directions and enjoy a good book of philosophy. 

I don't know if this makes any sense to anyone or if I'm all alone feeling like this, but please tell me your thoughts on this. Do you think i should just keep on searching inwards or what?",2021-01-09T00:31:10.000Z,18

AskMen,pristontale,I think I found my dream girl...at my dream job. What do I do?,"I’m 26 and I work my dream job. It pays six figures a year and the people I work with are amazing. We’re basically family. A year ago we hired a new person (26F) and ever since she got hired, we established instant chemistry. My coworkers notice it and they’ve been telling me to ask her out. They say that they’ve never seen so much chemistry between two people. I thought about making a move but I always had a rule to never shit where I eat. So I tried to back off, limited our interactions, and dated other women; however, my heart just wasn’t in it. It would be unfair to other women because at the end of each day, I always end up thinking of my coworker. Other men at work and outside of work tried to hit on her too, but she refused all of them. I do not know what to do now. At my previous job, a scenario like this happened with a different woman and I did not do anything about it. We ended up moving to different states and I still wonder what would have happened if I made a move on her. Mind you that my previous job was soul-crushingly terrible and I still chose to not dip my pen in company ink. I like to compartmentalize my life. I keep work and work friends separate from life and life friends. But right now I am having a very difficult time.

Feminism,[deleted],attitudes around sex work,"as a young woman (i’m 17) i find the way sex work is being presented to people my age (often by feminists!) to be very disturbing. i switched from liberal to radical feminism* mostly because of this reason. mainstream liberal feminism is doing women a disservice, i think, by framing prostitution and porn as empowering to women.

i feel like more and more young women are being pressured almost, into starting onlyfans or joining the porn industry because it’s so normalized. i’ve even seen people tell teenagers my age to start an onlyfans when they turn 18. and many liberal feminists encourage this! they talk about sex work like it’s any other form of labor, but it clearly isn’t. most prostitutes want to leave prostitution. sex workers are often traumatized by their jobs in ways that other workers absolutely are not. 

if all work is coerced under capitalism, and coerced sex is rape, why are so-called feminists *encouraging* vulnerable young people to get into sex work? it’s truly disappointing to me that this is what feminism has become, and that saying “porn and prostitution harm women” is a radical opinion in feminist spaces.

Feminism,notagainx,Body hair &amp; society | How did you grow comfortable showing body hair (legs/underarms) in public?,"So, I've stopped removing my body hair in large quantities (like clean shaving anywhere) because I've found the more I do it, the more uncomfortable I get. 2 days after shaving/waxing I'd grow ingrown hairs and get rashes everywhere regardless of the style of body hair removal, so I stopped shaving my legs and now I only trim my pubic hair for comfort (and easy deodorant application

I stopped for a few reasons, it was uncomfortable, it was something I felt I had to do 2-3 times a week to maintain the 'smooth' look but I asked myself why I did it and did some researching and found out that majority of the ideas of body hair being 'uncleanly' or 'ugly' only applies when it's on women and is deep rooted in social standards and practices such as fashion, modelling and (surprise, surprise) misogyny! 

After finding out why I was doing it I slowly felt more comfortable going out unshaven but mostly because I never wore short skirts or strapless shirt outside. With lockdown it's made me more comfortable but I want to be able to go outside and not fear what others will think or, God forbid, comment on my underarm hair or leg hair. Part of me is scared and the other part of me is confident but I can't help but feel uneasy when I want to wear a skirt outside or wear short sleeves. 

(For context, I live in a fairly toxic part of a major city (strong misogynistic views and too much violence) and I'm a female person of colour (part of me is scared that people would comment on my body hair and relate it to my Black heritage and the not so lovely racism perception of me being a 'monkey'))

I'm scared, but I'm not backing down, I couldn't live with myself if I avoided the situation or didn't face him.

Ive been in fights but ive lost pretty much all of them, mostly due to circumstances out of my control, but still doesnt help mentally to have an all-loss record.

Ive not really thrown a single punch in my life, Ive wrestled and grappled in my fights, dropkicked, slapped on rare occasions, but never punched.

Ive had 0 MMA training. Striking doesnt feel natural to me at all. In the heat of the moment I feel HEAVY and SLOW and like my attacks wont hurt at all.

The guy im fighting has a lifelong history of street fights, he has mates that have been arrested for assault, he has a friend that is in jail for murder.

I know I wont learn nearly enough in a week to be worth much, but I want to prepare myself the best I can.

What, if anything, can I practice to help me land some blows and cause some serious damage in this fight.

Feminism,ifalatefa,"\"She told me: you're dirt\"- Irish mother and home report published","Nine thousand children died in Ireland’s Mother and Baby Homes between 1922 and 1998, including three-quarters of all the children born, or admitted to one home in one year during the second World War.

In all, 15 per cent of the approximately 57,000 children who were in the 18 institutions investigated by the Mother and Baby Homes Commission died during their time there.

The “very high rate of infant mortality” during the first year of the babies’ lives in the institutions “is probably the most disquieting feature of these institutions,” the Commission report, published on Tuesday, found.

“In the years 1945-46, the death rate among infants” in the homes “was almost twice that of the national average for ‘illegitimate’ children,” it said. The term “illegitimate”, referring to children born to unmarried mothers, was used in Ireland until 1987.

In Bessborough in Cork, 75.19 per cent of all babies admitted to, or born in the home during the course of 1943 died in infancy, according to the report.

“Infant mortality rates fell to just over 12 per cent in 1946 and continued a downward trend. By 1952, the infant mortality rate [there] stood at 2.15 per cent,” the report states.

AskMen,DRAT73,Men of reddit. Is it a normal conclusion that one is gay when one says I am not into girls?,I am not into dating so when people ask if I have a gf I say no I am not into girls. I thought this was a normal thing since I am autistic until one day a sales person  at the mall asked me if I had a girlfriend and I said the same thing I have always said and he asked if was gay I said no I am not into anyone. Is that a normal conclusion for when one says I am not into girls? Because I have been saying this for years. Also no I am not asexual since I have a feeling that is going to be a question. I get just as horny as every other male. The reason I don't want to date is the fact that girls are slot of work and I don't have the time or energy to deal with them.

Feminism,claudigee,PMS Research!,"Calling all lovely ladies!

Reaching out to women to answer questions in an online survey for my dissertation about their experiences with pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), alongside attitudes towards menstruation and body confidence.

(I am analysing a feminist perspective that PMS could be considered a social construct within my dissertation). 

The survey shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes of your time and all responses are anonymous. 

Your opinion and experience is greatly appreciated!

AskMen,confake,What are the best rejection message to receive,"Hello! What are the best rejection message to receive? 

Often, I encounter situations where men would ask for my number while I'm out. Truth be told, I suck at saying no and I'm known to be a people-pleaser (working on it). Men would normally ask me to give a miss call so that they would get my number. 

What would be your preferred rejection message after you send the first\"hi\"? I do not want to hurt your ego. You are good looking and all, however, I'm attached. So it's a no go.

\"Hello! It was nice meeting you just now. Sorry, but I'm attached right now and it would be unwise to pursue anything. I wish you all the best, and hope to see you around in the future!\"

However that sounds like I'm assuming the guy wants to progress further. On a second vein of thought, no men would ask for my number just to be platonic right?

Edit/ what are your thoughts on ghosting? To not reply to the first text message 'hi'.

Edit/ I need message template to reply to his 'hi'. I do know it was wrong of me to give out my number. A lot of you guys told me to say no. However, it feels a little rude, no?

I came across a (blatantly misogynistic) take on Youtube referencing it as an example of hypergamy and highlighting it's popularity as evidence that women fetishise abuse by a dominator in the hope of taming masculinity presented as untamable. 

Clearly this take gives primacy to the nature of 'women's desire to be dominated' in cases of abuse and while I understand how deplorable and demented this view is I am interested in how specifically to respond to the use of 50 shades as an example of the viewpoint?",2021-01-13T11:36:43.000Z,10

AskMen,Jb1744,How to tell a woman you’re interested in to stop wearing so much perfume.,"Fellas, just like the title says. I met this girl at a gym, and when she walked by, I could smell her fragrance. I didn’t think too much of it, but long story short, we started talking and well, you know...

Fast forward, on our date nights, casual walks at the beach, she wears the fragrance and it’s strong. Mind you, it’s the type that lingers in your car, in your fabrics, etc... 

We aren’t a thing anymore (since last year), i was very busy with my career and when the covid shutdowns happened, she wanted more attention that I couldn’t provide since she was laid off but I was still working onsite/remotely. 

Nevertheless, how would you go about telling someone like that to tone it down with the fragrance, just be blunt about it, or... maybe should this post belong to the askWomen subreddit, I’m curious on how to go about this if you’re genuinely interested in pursuing the relationship. 

My quick thought, I feel like this should come from a friend and not your partner. But feel free to disagree.",2021-01-05T21:08:46.000Z,20

I just keep getting FOMO and it sometimes pisses me off or makes me sad. I don't know how to feel about it - all my college friends have full corporate gigs like me and we all chat and meet up 1-2 times a year. So no hard feelings there.   


I mean this sounds horrible ( I have a great career, make great money, health and family) but for some reason, I just get on myself about how much they are always out just enjoying themselves while I'm grinding at home behind a desk.  


I try to go to the range by myself after work, or workout and it makes me feel better.. but sometimes I just want to do it with friends - but I can't take off in the middle of the day or do spur of the moment events like they can.  


Does anyone else experience this?  If so how do you deal with it, what do you do?  I'm sure when my Fiance and I start having kids ( I hope at least) it will be different.. but FOMO just keeps hitting ALL the TIME.",2021-01-22T17:00:28.000Z,1

AskMen,OhNaturel,What is your quiting story? I'm working at a dead end job and need encouragement/ a light at the end of the tunnel.,"I've been working here for 7 years, at first there was room to progress with the company eventually becoming a Supervisor. Promises where made by my Manager to suggest this, \"Once a spot opens up, it's yours.\"

Long story short, we voted in a Union about 2 years ago now, and because of seniority I landed back at the position I started with the company, 7 years ago.

How should I deal with this situation? What is your quiting a dead end job story? Is it worth staying here without an opportunity to move up?",2021-01-27T00:03:28.000Z,15

AskMen,The_Enemy_Spider,How can I be manly even if I'm short?,"I don't really mind my short height, the only problem is that I think about tall men as more manly than shorter men, or at least every time I think about a manly man I automatically think about a tall guy, so what can I do to be manly even with my lack of height?  
I'm currently working out for mass and strength, taking care of the look of my face, making my mentality just how I think being manly is, and learning martial art and other stuff to fulfill my dreams, do you think that all of this will make me manly even without being tall?

I know that manly is kind of an abstract word, so I'm gonna precise that for manly I mean it in the more stereotyped way possible, so strong, cool, confident and full of honor man who protect what he loves whatever it takes.

Thank really much for the help in advance!",2021-01-27T00:05:21.000Z,40

Feminism,notafrequentflyerr,Can we call out women’s behavior without saying “If the roles we’re reversed....”,"Maybe it’s just me but hearing the phrase “If the roles we’re reversed...” always makes me cringe so hard. It’s great to call out behavior that’s wrong, but saying that phrase implies that feminism is hypocritical and that women complain about sexism or rape culture but are doing the same thing that men are or that there is some secret reverse sexism. Also, I feel like it also gives off the vibe that women will care about women’s issues but ignore men’s issues in order to prove their point. It’s like saying oh since a man is experiencing this, women are ignoring it because it doesn’t play into their victim hood. Men could advocate for themselves as well and try to take down these toxic behaviors, I don’t understand how it falls to feminism to get justice for ourselves AND for the people who perpetuate the system. 

All in all, I feel like that phrasing always rubs me the wrong way, if anyone wants to explain or thinks that’s wrong I’m open to hearing it.",2021-01-26T17:55:58.000Z,8

AskMen,Ariel9970,What should you do if your friends are holding your back from your goals?,"Hey Reddit.

I’m 21 years old from Israel.
Got a question that troubles me for a long time now.
I have many friends, and I have many goals.

I want to get fit, sleep well, study, make money online, etc.

My issue is that all of my friends aren’t aligned to these goals. They smoke weed all the time, drink alcohol, stay up until late, don’t have many life goals, etc.

I am very annoyed by this because I can’t really mix the two together (maybe except in the weekends, but even then I lose sleep and engage in alcohol, junk food and such activities).

I had many beautiful experiences with friends, and I have lots of bad feelings thinking about leaving them.

I credit this (not solely but majorly) with my negativity and first strike personality - something I continue to work very hard at to correct. I still have trouble being vulnerable and getting into relationships as I believe my emotional switch has been muted significantly, if not turned off all together, at least for the time being.

My dad is the typical Dad boomer, that believes in \"work hard\" rather than \"work smart\". The business is about water pumps, and other services related to water systems. Growing up I've seen him work hard as hell, over fixated to his job waking up at 8 am and starts working immediately until 12am. I realized that this isn't the type of business I would want because of how little free time he had. Currently, I spend my time learning chess, reading, cooking, working out, playing video games, and helping my dad out whenever he needs something done. But my dad sees everything I do that's not related to his business, a waste of time. I am now in a tough spot since I am stuck in his house, being pressured everyday. The look on his face whenever he sees me paints nothing but disappointment. Believe me I've tried to convince myself to get into his business, thinking that it doesn't matter as long as I'm gonna make money, but it just doesn't work out mainly because of how he treats people like garbage, including me.",2021-01-28T08:15:08.000Z,21

AskMen,daggerxdarling,"Dear Men, What Are Your Tips for a Woman Who Has Trouble Initiating Sex?","I know this probably sounds silly. It should be easy, right? Just do anything, say \"hey let's fuck,\" something like that. But what are more subtle/other ways I can try? I've had a history of trauma that doesn't need going into, but it's led to me rarely being in a place with the agency to ask for sex or make the first move - and that makes it extremely difficult for me to be vocal when I do want sex as I'm still not used to having that option. I can think it in my head, but i can't really get the words out quite right. I don't want my husband to think I'm not attracted to him or I'm uninterested in the physical aspect of our relationship (bc it's GOOD and I'm a FAN, oof). I'm trying to think of ways that aren't \"hey, let's fuck/wanna have sex\" because I'm not quite comfortable saying that even when I'm thinking it. Are there actions or maybe a different phrasing that has worked from women you've been with? I've definitely initiated before, it's not that I'm completely incapable! Our sex life is overall incredibly healthy and more frequent than most - I'm just hoping for ideas, I guess? Different ways to show I want to initiate, if that makes sense. I hope this gets seen, and thanks in advance for any advice if it does! 3am is a weird time to post, haha.

ETA: tl;dr: i suck at asking for sex but i really want to get better at it, send help.",2021-01-28T08:17:33.000Z,74

AskMen,angelbabybee,[Serious] Any other men out there have problems with frequent urination? What was the solution?,"I am asking for experiences from men in specific because i am truly kind of worried..


&amp; I am posting this on behalf of my boyfriend bc he doesn’t see a problem. He urinates about 4-6 times per hour, and they are full streams. Not just just little dribbles..


It’s gotten to the point where it affects our day to day life. He has to plan bathroom stops if we go anywhere (grocery store, target, etc). The most he has peed (full streams) in an hour is 8 times.


Anyway, he went to the doctor and they took only a blood test, everything came back good. No red flags. But I’m pushing for him to get a second opinion or something... because this just isn’t right. But he’s refusing to. He’s saying since the doctor said he’s fine, then he’s fine.. And this just barely started happening like 6 months ago out of no where! Has anyone ever had an experience like this as a male?


For reference, he’s 24, very fit, 5’9, 185lbs, does weight lifting. Does not take pre-workout or caffeine. Drinks a very normal amount of water. Not enough to pee this often but I’m not sure.

I can’t grow facial hair as it’s extremely sparse and inconsistent . On the plus side, women of my ethnicity find me attractive as I’m fit and have the face that is considered attractive in my ethnicity’s country, but I’m American and don’t identify with that aesthetic (body aside). They’re also not really my type. 

Things I already do pretty well:

*good fashion and wear clothes that fit (get complimented a decent amount). I don’t think fashion advice is my issue as I’m pretty aware of what’s considered more boy ish to wear (eg graphic tees, basketball shorts, certain types of hats, etc. )

* lift and run, girls compliment my body a lot, eg comments about broad shoulders though I think they’re just normal tbh 

* demeanor, people have told me I act/seem very confident and mature

AskMen,Grimsrasatoas,How in the strawberry frosted fuck am I supposed to properly moisturize when I'm constantly washing my hands?,"I live in New England and as per, it's super dry up in this area this time of year so my hands always dry out. Now couple that with trying to stay healthy by washing my hands pretty frequently so I don't get 'Rona'd and you could probably use the backs of my hands as sandpaper. How do I keep them properly moisturized when I'm washing the moisturizer off what seems like every few minutes? I know you should do it after warm/hot water (like a shower or something) but it still seems like 20 minutes later, I'm going through the motions again. Another issue is that I normally hate moisturizer, no matter which one I use, it feels like I have greasy hands longer than I should. I've found a couple I like more than most: Lubriderm advanced therapy (the pink cap/label) and vaseline hand sanitizer lotion, for self explanatory reasons. Do I just reapply every time? That seems wasteful. Do I find a better moisturizer? I'm not talking about general skin care, I'm more concerned with keeping my knuckles from bleeding by just being out in the open.",2021-01-11T02:41:21.000Z,20

I love him ,but we cant seem to speak for more than once or so in a few months without it becoming forced and leaving both of us on edge .

My dad has always did his best to be there for me ,but we only seemed to really bond when i was a teenager and that was after we started getting high together. At first that was awesome but as i have gotten older and i have went through my own life situations. I seem to have missed a page with my dad .

Im not talking shit on my dad ,i am just trying to figure out how to aproach him anymore. The only thing we seem to be able to talk about without it being semi aggressive is weed or music and even that can get testy if he has been drinking. 

Any input would be appreciated i am at a loss anymore . Thanks again",2021-01-12T22:51:55.000Z,26

I've decided to continue pursuing my air force career plan. I had to end my relationship with my partner. She did not support the idea of me going into the military, and it would not have worked out. The uncertainty of trying to find a new career to preserve this relationship haunted me. However, looking forward and hearing horror stories, I just can't help but wonder if I will ever find someone good again and willing to stay with me if I am constantly deploying overseas or being moved around.

AskMen,anxiousthespian,"Burlesque performers, male strippers, etc. How do you all maintain a visible erection while dancing?","In any sort of sexual performance, like a burlesque show, men typically wear very tight shorts or g-strings to clearly display their penises *without* actually showing it. That's part of the fun of a strip tease, *almost* seeing it but not quite.

But I keep seeing these tips or life hacks where guys suggest flexing a random muscle to get rid of an unwanted boner. The logic here being that more blood will flow to the muscle to keep it flush with oxygen, and supposedly with less blood flow to the dick, the erection will go away.

If this is all correct... when you dance, shouldn't you struggle to keep yourself hard? Those performances are extremely impressive and an incredible full body workout, so you'd need your blood supply focused on your heart, lungs, muscles, and brain. But as mentioned before, having a super obvious dick in and of itself is a part of the performance.

So how do you stay hard while expending all of that energy on dancing?",2021-01-05T08:16:02.000Z,1

AskMen,UselessIdiotAlways,"Do you have one/no testicle or know anyone like that. How do you cope with it? How is the life? What do people who see you naked say about it. I know weird ques, more in description.","I lost both my testicles due to being shy and not asking for treatment for torsion when I was 13/14. They now lie dead in my sack, they are approximate size of ear buds. Doctor said there is no harm in them lying there, but I am on testosterone for the rest of my life. I cannot produce any sperm in my ejaculate. This has made my life very hard and I dont date anyone for the fear of this. My confidence due to this is 0. How did you cope with this?

Edit : I have read each and every reply here. I had never talked about this to another soul. Only 2 people (my parents) know I have this problem and I just talked them about treatment, not the emotional baggage this leaves me with. Reading all the replies made me feel a lot lot better. I cant reply to everyone but I am really really thankful to all of you for replying. This increased my confidence alot. 

For some recurring comments : 

I have considered prosthetic balls, they put silicon balls in scrotum. Will get them in a year or two just to get the feel. 

I get horny, I get erections. I have to take testosterone every 3 weeks, so 3 days after the injection is my peak horniness. If testosterone runs out of my body I dont produce any ejaculate, I get erections but they arent as stiff and no matter what I do I cant orgasm if I dont have testosterone. 

Again thank you all, it was a really huge confidence boost.

**PSA : NEVER IGNORE PAIN IN TESTICLES. RUN TO HOSPITAL THE MOMENT YOU FEEL IT. YOUR BALLS WILL DIE WITHIN 2-3 HRS IF THERE IS TORSION**",2021-01-05T08:40:28.000Z,1482

Today after an entire week of building positive momentum I've spent time with like 4 females and 2 guys yet without actually getting to the point of us having fun (calls or hangouts etc.)

One of them was even my mom who I've been talking to for about an hour while helping her in the kitchen (attachment style and oversharing, go figure) only for her laughing to make me move on from a point or telling me to pray in silence (like in words). 

(Tbh i did have some fun with a guy friend before he got busy and one female friend couldn't come over bcs of the rain)

Now my day is over and I'm tired. Frustrated. Idk what to do. I don't want to go back to my studies and I don't deserve to relax. Last time this happened last week I spent 8hrs on Minecraft minimum just to talk with my family again.

In the end I just wanted to play with someone but ended up chatting with them for about an hour each without any results

Feminism,NerdKing10001,Why can't a girl can't be Batman? A woman's POV (Cassandra Cain),"I'm a guy but do consider myself a feminist and wanted to discuss this If you like Comics or saw that terrible Birds Of Prey Movies you may have heard of Cassandra Cain. She's super cool. A better fighter than Batman who was abused by her father David Cain from birth and denied to right of learning to read and write  and speak. Being an assassin he wanted to create the perfect killer and he believed if you learned to communicate via body language you'd be able to predict movements. He was right and Cass is one of the best fighters in DC comics. After her first kill she read the person's she killed body as he died and basically felt what he did. To make a long story short she ran away and swore off killing and ended up becoming the second Batgirl. Working under Batman.  


Cass adores Batman, his code and his mission. She is more skilled than him and as she learns to read, write and speak we see she's pretty damn smart and willing to learn. She has outright said she wants to be Batman. She wants to take over. She has everything that makes Bruce Batman. And even more than Dick Greyson. The First Robin who normally takes over the role doesn't even want it. She Does.   


And whenever someone says she should be Batman they say a girl can't be Batman. \"the name is BatMAN\" is a comment I see a lot.  I was wondering what people here felt about the idea about this.",2021-01-01T23:12:56.000Z,25
