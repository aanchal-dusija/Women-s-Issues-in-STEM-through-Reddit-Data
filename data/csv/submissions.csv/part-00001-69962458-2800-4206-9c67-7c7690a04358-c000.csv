but it got me thinking, i'm not a kid anymore, in anyway. hell i'm not even a teenager or young adult. 

I've always been obsessed with the next thing, in primary i wanted to be in secondary, in secondary college and in college Uni. so i always pictured myself being further along in my life at this age. i didn't expect to still be here feeling like im treading water. stuck and not moving on.

but when i try to plan how to move on i feel trapped, like i can't or that theres always as excuse. right now it's covid and my living situation, i can't travel, job market is lacking at best and everwhere is shut, i know it's for the best i'm not complaing about lockdown, i just feel like it's giving me an excuse to not move on.

i just worry i'm falling behind here, i look around and see everyone moving on or i go online and see people living the life i want and now i just can't seem to find out how i get it.
i feel like i'm wasting my life.",2021-01-21T00:27:46.000Z,4

I am particularly focused on career success / accumulating material wealth; and constantly worry that I am not doing enough to prepare for the future.

While I have recently been trying more to “go with the flow” and live in the present moment, I worry I that I will regret not taking these things seriously enough in this stage in my life (esp. when I start a family and have children). 

For those of you that are happy / fulfilled in your 40’s-50’s or have been generally happy throughout your life - can you offer any advice on mindset changes / behavioral changes that made your life more enjoyable?

AskMen,Troy_Otto,How many chances do you give people?,"I was supposed to hang out with someone yesterday, but they apparently forgot that they made plans with me and cancelled on me. They mentioned next time, but I didn't respond. I've been cancelled on so many times throughout my life and I've given people chance after chance after chance. They always forget that they made plans with me. It just shows me how unimportant I am to everyone.

I've recently cut some people off because I've already given them too many chances. With this person though, this is the first time they've done this to me. Should I give them another chance if they reach out, or should I be done with them?",2021-01-10T14:46:09.000Z,42
AskMen,thatcanbearranged_1,Why don't I find sports interesting anymore?,"I (24M) have watched sports my entire life: NFL, NBA, college football and basketball, occasionally men's golf and tennis (just the big tournaments), and most recently Formula 1.

I used to watch as many NFL/college football games as possible, and I would try to follow the NBA as closely as I could. Frankly, I was taking a bit of pride in knowing so much about each team: the coaches, upcoming trades, playoffs predictions, etc. I have so many fond memories of watching NFL **all day long**, and loving every second of it. The same goes for NBA playoffs.

But ever since I graduated college, sports haven't been as interesting to me. **Has anyone else experienced this kind of \"sports fatigue?\"** Maybe my interest has simply run its course. Maybe sports isn't as exciting because now that I'm 24 going on 25, professional athletes aren't as superhero-like to me since . . . we're like the same age. Plus, sitting on a couch for most of my weekend just doesn't sound fun anymore.

Admittedly, I still have a blast watching big games with my buddies. But I can't bring myself to watch weeknight games by myself anymore.

Just wondering if anyone else is finding themselves getting more disenchanted with sports?",2021-01-10T14:46:36.000Z,112

I’ve had the same 7 friends since I was 13. I’m 18 now. For the first 3-4 years of our friendship, we were all alike and found the same things in common. Over time as we turned 17-18 years old, we all started to change. I know it’s obvious that a change was gonna come, but not in a way that I would think. Everything about them is completely different to me, even the way they dress. Most of them have this e-boy skater thing going on while I just look like a normal dude, which I like the way I dress and don’t intend to follow a trend. They live a life style around weed, nicotine and occasionally alcohol that I try to stay away from because I was addicted to nicotine since I was 15 and finally quit 3 months ago. The amount of interests we have together are now slim to none, even down to music. As of late, when I hangout with them I’ve often felt like I HAVE to hangout with them because I have no other group. When we all walk around in public, I always feel like the odd man out. Like if people looked at our group I feel like they would look directly at me and go “you don’t seem like you belong here”. I almost feel as if this group of friends doesn’t have a bright reflection of who I am. I’ve started to look at them in a different light and asked myself if maybe it’s time to start finding friends who share more interests with me. It’s hard to think about that when I’ve grown up with these guys and are essentially the only brothers I ever had. What should I do?",2021-01-19T13:34:45.000Z,8

AskMen,beat_physics,How to deal with twin brother (26) who believes in right-wing conspiracy theories?,"Here in the United States, we are living in a tumultuous time.  All things point to President Trump having incited the Capitol Riot after months of his Stop the Steal campaign.  However, my twin brother (26) does not believe the “narrative” that the media presents.  

I will spare you the fine details of his conspiracy theories.  In general, he is a staunch defender of President Trump, thinks that the 2020 Presidential Election was rigged, believes that a “deep state” headed by Democrats controls the Media, and says that the Capitol Riot was a “false flag attack”.

I have debated him on these topics because I disagree with him on these matters.  And his main arguments are based on the ideas that the media brainwashes the public and that the “deep state” hides their misdeeds.  I have provided him articles, etc., that debunk his ideas but he does budge and links me more and more confirmation bias, misinformation, and forged evidence.  

I am losing my appetite for debate as I get the sense that I cannot get him to concede.  What would be the best way to go about ending our discussion on these matters without sounding like an asshole?  We converse via text because we live hundreds of miles away.  I am thinking of saying that we should discuss different topics at the very least.",2021-01-17T20:26:31.000Z,41

AskMen,skribsbb,"Introverted fathers with difficult kids, how do you keep from snapping when your kids misbehave?","I've always been apprehensive about having kids.  Several years ago, I started a job working with kids.  I'll have a group of kids for an hour, and then another group, and so on.  Some of the kids I love, some I can barely stand.  I look at the ones I can barely stand and think \"if that were my kid, and I couldn't give them back after an hour, I'd snap.\"

I don't know exactly what that means.  That's the nature of snapping.  But I'm worried that if I were in that situation, then someone would get hurt.

I am an introvert. I need private time to decompress. I live alone. So whenever I've had a rough day, I can go be alone and recharge.   If I had a kid, and the kid was the cause of my rough day, I'm not sure what I'd do.  And while if I had a good kid I'm sure I'd be okay, if I had a tough kid where the bad attitude was never-ending, I feel I'd lose it.

Or anything else that requires balancing his body. We tried those electric scooters in the city where you use an app to use them. We spent nearly an hour trying to get him to get going on it but he would push off and then just keel over. I asked him if he ever had one of those razors as a kid that I thought everybody went on before, but he said no.

I took him ice skating recently thinking this could help him balance. Poor guy was falling feet up. To be fair he did improve a bit but cannot skate off the walls more than 2-3 seconds. It was like watching a golden retriever on ice.

Obviously I don’t mind at all that he has no balance and it’s been pretty fun trying out new stuff he’s never tried before :) He has an interest in all of these and wants to learn! I don’t think his parents ever took him on bikes, scooters, ice skating etc. as a kid. I know guys and girls have different centers of gravity so I thought maybe that could play into it... have any you guys here have had terrible balance before?

AskMen,JoeRoganFan55,"If I’m in a good position in life, why do I still have a desire for change?","Hey guys, I (24m) live in the Midwest. Good job, great company, living with my parents while I’m paying off my loans. I don’t know if it’s quarantine or the long winter getting to me, but the thought of just moving out of state into the south and finding a job there sounds incredible right now. I hate the winters, I have vitamin D issues and the days are long and I’m not a fan of the cold at all. 

This is just part of the reason, however. As mentioned above, I love my company but the job I’m doing now just doesn’t satisfy me and it fills me with anxiety. ( I have generated anxiety disorder so that doesn’t help either). The idea of being able to just get out and take a leap of faith while I’m young sounds enticing and I’m worried I’ll never get this opportunity again. 

In theory, I should be very content with where I’m at. Great job, good family, good friends, etc. but the thought of moving south to a warmer, new environment sounds extremely appealing to me. Would I be foolish to entertain this thought? Anyone else been in a similar situation?

AskMen,JcSimba,What does “One True love” mean to you? Do you even believe in it?,"My girlfriend believes in this and even though I think Ill spend the rest of my life with her, I don’t believe in it. I honestly think every person has a large amount of people that they could be happy together for the rest of their lives (at least 1000 when I extremely lowball it) across the world. Realistically you just won’t meet most of them.

I think it just depending on circumstance, timing, etc. To share, my best friend moved to America from his home country and in his home country he had a girlfriend. He said she was the love of his life, but drastically due to circumstances it wouldn’t work out. He now has a girlfriend he’s happy with, but I honestly believed in some almost exactly the same alternate dimension my friend could be with his first love and things would still work out.",2021-01-31T20:17:50.000Z,12

I think the fetishization of lesbian and bi women is a very big issue. I really wish more feminists would talk about it. It comes from deep-rooted misogyny and makes men feel as though they have authority over women's relationships. I'm really happy Tee Noir talked about this. There's also an issue with the fetishization of gay and bi men (mostly in yaoi), but it's a bit different, and that discussion doesn't belong here.",2021-01-31T20:26:02.000Z,4

In this world, you'll be hard pressed to find a face with makeup on or head of hair not messy and undone. Doctors work in their nightgowns and bank tellers drive to work barefoot. Usual business standards are thrown out the window.

We went out and I was really excited about this. I wasn't looking for anyone at the time and he came out of nowhere. 

However, after the first month  he seemed to really just get in his head and I became a soundboard with no \"benefits\" and by benefits I mean I didn't get to see him. He stopped sexting me and he doesn't want to hang out with me. I try and try and he tells me he has too much going on in his life. **But still uses me to open up about what's going on in his life.** He still messages me every day, he still tells me about his problems and his family and his life. It's like he's coming up with all these excuses and still wants to hold onto me and I can't tell if he genuinely is still interested or why.

He's told me he has a tough time letting me in completely because of 2 relationships that he opened himself up to completely to (in the past)  and both woman both screwed him over in the end. I know that happened and I know what a f\\*cked up situation it was. 

I want to hold onto hope that he'll see I'm not a bad person that I don't have malicious intentions and that I like him no matter what. But I don't know how to help if he won't let me see him.",2021-01-03T20:45:19.000Z,29

AskMen,Jack__Fearow,"Men of Reddit, how the hell did you figure out what you wanted to do with your life for a career? Assuming you found it.","Asking as I'm nearly a 26 year old man, who has a family and still has not figured it out. 

I joined the Army at 17. Worked on radars. Got out after 5 years. 

I feel as if I'm a failure for not finding what it is I want to do as a career. I've worked a few warehouse jobs, delivery jobs, and as of the moment, I'm in a trade job (non-union spray foam applicator). 

I didn't feel any satisfaction from any of the jobs I've had. 

I love technology and thought about getting into IT. I then realized I'd probably hate doing that as a career, even though I love doing IT related stuff at home. I also feel as if I wouldn't be good at it.

I'm a huge history buff, I'm a hobbyist genealogist by nature and I love research. Unfortunately, becoming a professional genealogist and starting a business is quite difficult nowadays, which lead me to archiving. I wouldn't mind working with old documents and such. 

The main issue, besides finding a career is the sheer fact I have to work 70-90 hours a week just to provide for my family. I have to work. Which means I'd have hardly any time to go to college (I never know when I'll get off of work each day).

Obviously, even in a career, there are going to be days you don't like what you do, or just days that you hate. But, I don't want jobs anymore, I want a career. Sure, I need to make at least a certain amount of money, but, money isn't my drive. 

So, men, any advice? I'm willing to hear anyone out.",2021-01-14T03:53:01.000Z,17

If so what did you do to get over it?","I grew up in a pretty poor part of my town and most just accepted it. It wasn’t until high school where my counselor really encouraged college as an option for me. I’m thankful for the counselor because I have a pretty good job and an education. Most of the school was poor, but school was a way out.

I went to visit on old friend from high school and he had a lot of hardships growing up. He had to drop out of high school because his mother needed help with bills. Now he has a wife and 2 kids, but he is definitely not doing well financial. When I left, all I felt was an overwhelming sense of guilt because most of my friends from high school were still stuck in the cycle of poverty and I got out of it. 

Even at my job, most of my coworkers never had to deal with being poor and many came from decent money. (Their parents were all professionals and had degrees). Is this a normal feeling?

We eventually fell in love and asked each other out. And now after 3 months of dating, she doesn't ask me anything. She doesn't show any interest. In fact, when I try to share something interesting about these things, she either ignores it or goes \"hmmm cool\" and changes the topic to some reality show she's been watching or some stand up comedy video she saw.

I’ve been hooking up with a guy for a few months and he gives me forehead kisses, holds my hand, cuddles, etc. which is stuff I personally only do with someone I’m in a relationship with so i found it a bit odd. 

So I’m curious where do you draw the line? Are there things you reserve only when in a relationship? Or do you just sort of go with the flow of things and there isn’t really a boundary for you?",2021-01-28T03:14:32.000Z,20

AskMen,OhNaturel,"Has anyone ever had a \"happy ending\" from a legit massage therapist? How do it happen? Keep names out of it","I'm 27 male and got a massage from a woman 45. First time getting a massage. 

I walk in and she tells me to dress down to my comfort level, naturally I ask what works best for her. She told me to get fully naked and get under the sheet, ok not a problem.
I get under this thin sheet that is so thin you can see through it. She walks in and starts the massage on my back, mind you she did no tucking in around my waist or anywhere else.. While she is massaging my back she works her way down to my glutes. The sheet is completely off my ass at this point. When it was time to flip over she removes the sheet completely from my body and looks me in the eyes and says ok flip over with a smile. Noting is covering me at this point and I'm completely naked! Puts the sheet over me when I flip over and continues the massage, again not tucking me in the sheet at all though it was covering my junk but I could see through it.

Nothing happened after that, no happy ending.. But I was talking to buddies and they said that's not normal?

I guess my question is has this ever happened to you? Did it go further? If so how did you bring it up? Ladies feel free to weigh in",2021-01-06T14:39:46.000Z,58

AskMen,Roacher21,How have video games changed the way you live your life?,"I've been thinking about this quite a bit for the past few years and not sure if anyone else has a similar experience. Many years ago when I first played Skyrim (2012) I was in awe at the beauty of the world and the scenery in it. In the winter when things were snow covered, cold, and quiet I called those peaceful little event \"skyrim moments\". As I got older and was able to drive I started going out in nature and hiking in the mountains to chase those sorts of moments. Fast forward to now and I'm a fairly avid hiker and really enjoy the outdoors when I'm not in school. I'm even in an environmental science program and hope to do a lot of outdoor work when I graduate. I definitely owe my initial awareness and appreciation for nature and the beauty that can be found in it to playing that game all those years ago. Red dead redemption 2 gave me that same outdoorsy motivation as well. Has anyone else found a hobby or interest through gaming?",2021-01-17T12:50:40.000Z,31

AskMen,wangrater,How do I handle a friend who keeps “playfully” hitting me?,"We are apartment neighbors and “friends” (or so he thinks) but he has a tendency to hit/punch “playfully” (especially if we play smash together which I’ve since stopped). He’s a big guy and while his hits are not enough to injure me, they are enough to make me sore and no matter how much I say he just flat out ignores me. He’s “apologized” but it still happens. I feel like he’s being condescending. 

I don’t feel like I could make a legal case but it just bugs the hell out of me and I *hate* the fact that I’ve started habitually physically cringing when I’m around him. At this point fuck him and fuck our friendship I just want him to never bother me again but the thing is I wrecked my car and whenever I need a ride to someplace the bus doesn’t go I need to ask him. He always says yes. Let me be clear I’m super grateful and I’ve tried to pay him back but he doesn’t want any pay.  I feel like he’s holding it over my head and using as a shield. I don’t know what to do. I know this was kind of long but I just want to vent and see if hopefully someone has any advice. 

I tried askreddit but they banned my post.",2021-01-04T06:25:17.000Z,48

Feminism,Infiniteliving7,Society's irrational obsession with women having long hair,"This topic may seem trivial, but it really is not. It really upsets me. 

One of the most oppressive things against women in this society is the aggressive pressuring of women to keep their hair long. Long hair is overrated and people give it way too much importance and praise. My father would continually repeat the Bible scripture about long hair being a women's glory to me. My brother told me and his wife to not cut our hair again. I had a coworker (when I had a pixie cut) ask me why I cut my long hair and that it was so pretty. It makes me so angry, I cannot even tell you. Hairs are just strings of protein! And yet people put so much importance on hair! Someone posts a picture on social media of a new haircut or style and it usually gets a lot of reactions. People are so shallow and stupid. Websites post articles about a celebrity changing their hair color and this is breaking news apparently. 

I currently have long hair and I am not hating on you if you have long hair. Long hair is nice, but I hate this pressure on females to have long hair.

I even read an article that said that pressuring women to keep their hair long is very misogynistic. It said something similar to what I have said. It sarcastically said \"yeah, because the amount of keratin a woman has on her head determines her sex appeal\". It was in response to some guy who said women can't be sexy without long hair. 

It makes me furious and I feel so oppressed and disrespected when society pressures women to have long hair. It is so irrational. I feel like the root of it is that society wants to keep women weak. Apparently the reason men started cutting their hair short was because Caesar Augustus had his men cut their hart short so they would do better in battle. The logic was that they couldn't get their hair pulled. Then you could equate society pressuring women to have long hair with wanting women to be vulnerable. It goes back to this too often ideal of wanting women to be weak and submissive. The examples are discouraging women from getting muscular, sometimes wanting women to be very thin, sometimes a male wanting a female to be fairly significantly shorter than him I think a part of pressuring women to have long hair is to help male dominance. 

I think this pressure for women to have long hair also stems from pressuring women to submit by pressuring us to be overly concerned with our appearance. I feel like this keeps us insecure and oppressed. They want us overly concerned with our appearance versus wanting us to impact the world, create, and achieve things.

Edit: I just hate society trying to control what I do with MY hair. I feel so controlled, violated, disrespected, and oppressed. Society should not bully and pressure women about what we do with our own hair. It's a violation of our freedom and rights really. Again, this topic may seem trivial, but it is not. I have acquired so much emotional and mental trauma over the years from this ideal they force on us.",2021-01-26T02:22:49.000Z,21

AskMen,[deleted],"Men of Reddit Who have no interest in sports: do you feel like you were born with something missing? Have you figured out how to relate to other men around sports, and if so, how?","My dad died when I was young, and even though my mom tried to get my brothers and I involved in sports, it usually ended up in humiliation from a complete ignorance of how the sport was played. Turns out that even in the early years, they expect you to know how to play baseball and football when you join the team.

I understand most sports at a technical level, and enjoy the experience of attending life games, but I have zero interest in following teams, memorizing stats, or Engaging it as anything other than a way to be around other guys. I’ve always felt like I was missing some gene or something; that there was something wrong with me because I just can’t get excited about sports. At parties the conversation inevitably turns to sports, and I stand around like an idiot, grinning stupidly because I really have no idea what’s going on and have nothing to contribute.

Have you figured out how to deal with this? What do you do? I love my guy friends, and I’m envious of their excitement and knowledge of players and the games, but I have no real interest in tackling it myself.

AskMen,BlissMeli,Compliment or bad thing: When men your age say you don't look your age?,"Honestly, how bad is it if a man tells you don't look your age?  
I've been constantly told in my study and work environment that I look very youthful. I still remember once working at an office and one of my colleagues mentioned he thought I was the grandchild of the manager because I seemed very youthful.  
Trying to be objective I know I have some physical and energy traits that might influence this, my height being more petite, my naturally curly hair (I keep it in the natural color as well), I dress modestly and I'm more a friendly bubbly than a serious person.  
Of course, has been a blessing in some ways, I connect very easily with children, elders and trust me very easily.  


However, I feel in the dating market or sexual dimension might not be a plus.

AskMen,JDMe_94,How much does a degree matter in a later stage of your career?,"Hello my fellow men,

I'm in search of a piece of advice or just anything that might help me make a decision, probably from the more experienced part of this community. I'm having some difficulties with making a good decision regarding the future of my professional career so I thought I could turn to you guys.

Some background:   
I'm 26 years old and have been working as a procurement consultant for 3 years. The client is a large chemical company where I'm part of the EMEA sourcing team. I've always wanted to be a consultant and enter the corporate world, which wasn't easy. I have a Master's degree in Criminological Sciences (wasn't the best student in my day, it was tough but I made it nonetheless) and I hoped that the degree would open the doors to consultancy. At first it didn't, but my current employer decided to hire me anyway and things have been good until a few weeks ago. 

I've been given positive feedback by the client time and time again. I've proven myself over and over to be a good employee but this didn't reflect itself in my salary review. It seems they don't really care about me and they just want me to remain billable. During a call with my manager at the client I found out that I should/could be making 20 k€ more annually and he advised to revise my plans for the future. My ambitions are to reach middle management and keep my options open for a higher position if I'd wish to in the future. The thing is, I don't have an economical background.

How big is the impact of a master's degree in economics when your career is already advanced? Do I combine study with work now that I'm still young (will be tough and idk if it is feasible) or doesn't this have any added value? I'm just scared that I'll remain stuck somewhere at the bottom until my retirement because I don't have the necessary qualifications on paper. 

Would you guys advise to just keep gaining experience and doing a good job or would you go back to studying to open up other opportunities with other employers and possibly having a shot at achieving my goals for the future?


Any feedback is massively welcome!

Thanks in advance :)",2021-01-28T17:53:22.000Z,15

AskMen,lucagee__,How do you guys set long term goals after achieving all your main objectives?,"Hello men of reddit, hope you're doing good!

I am one of those people that likes setting and achieving goals. It works for me and I really enjoy it.
I generally do a more short term (6 months) and a long term goal setting (3-5 years).

I have come to ask some advice on long term goal setting. 


The past month I have finally completed the last remaining goal on my 5 years plan(16-21 years old) within 6 months before the deadline: start a remunerative and satisfying career.
I'm very happy as I feel like I've set the foundations in all aspects of my life to further build upon.

Differently from the past, I do not have to make any radical changes to my life but rather continue progressing from where I left off in sentimental and non-sentimental relationships, career, personality, physique, hobbies etc.


I honestly feel like I have no goals anymore other than just maintaining and improving what I already achieved.
It feels disappointing, as I enjoy having generic long term goals to pursue along with more specific short term ones.

a)Why do relationships fail? 
b)Also, why do partners cheat?
c)Is there a way to prevent it?




I mean, I understand that people get to know eachother while dating and at the beginning of relationships. And they decide whether to stay with eachother or not.


But, when two people are in relationship, specially LTR, they are probably attracted to eachother and compatible enough that they have reached there.


Then why do people cheat? Or why do relationships fail?

And if all relationships finally end up like that, isn't it better to not enter any relationship from the start?


Thanks in advance",2021-01-05T10:32:22.000Z,81

   * The smartass girl
   * The guy that EVERYONE loves for some reason or other
   * The quiet dude who's otherwise pretty cool
* Every time I leave a drive thru restaurant, it seems like a line always forms or is in the process of forming shortly after I leave the drive thru. Without fail. 
* In all my \"serious relationships\", they asked me out
* In all my friend groups, I've always been the one who's distant from the rest of the group, kind of orbiting the group without ever being a true part of it

For me, the first explicit one, it was when I got stood up for a date at 18. Roughly 30 minutes into waiting for a data that would never come a lady in her mid-thirties approached me and asked me who was I waiting for. After sheepishly saying a date who I now realized stood me up. She said why would a handsome young man like me be stood up. 

There was also that one time when I was in driving school at 17 when a girl asked me out directly.

I saw her more more times after that, but while I was going out with her I remember the more subtle times girls attempted to get my attention; of course I didn't understood them.

I still have my occasional self-doubt but generally it felt like a heavy fog of negativity was lifted from my head.",2021-01-16T22:11:39.000Z,20

I feel alone with this thought because of society, I guess - you just gotta have kids. Can't imagine what my family would say if I decided so publicly. It would destroy my grandad for sure. And when your friends keep getting kids, the pressure keeps building as well.

Feel free to share. Maybe also dads who was in doubt once, but then all of a sudden turned and wanted kids... Maybe it happens one day. I just don't see it.",2021-01-25T00:09:56.000Z,41

AskMen,somelunacy,"Men of Reddit, how do you perceive love?","I know it's a dumb question, but as a girl, I've always been curious about how guys actually feel in this aspect. In this society we were always told and shown that men are tough, strong, violent, sex crazed and just don't show much emotion, mostly because they don't allow them to. As much as I adore men being softies, affectionate, caring, and loving, I want to know how love is in your eyes.

 How does it feel? What do you think? What goes on in your head? How do you show it? How do you express it? Can you say it as if you're writing a novel? Do you also feel the butterflies? Can you describe the feeling?

Feelings are often romanticed among girls, movies, books, poems. But I rarely see guys gushing over their crushes, loving chick flicks, blushing over love letters, being adorably cheesy, and being genuinely interested. Not just masking it with severe flirtatiousness to the point of it looking like the guy is a womanizing/fuccboi ass. And girls thoughts are often showcased and thoroughly narrated when it comes to romance. So yea.

Also other types of love is welcome. I just really want to know the emotional side of you men. I hope you're all safe and doing well.

Feminism,Influence-Background,My father just ashamed me for having a thrush,"First, i have to say I'm on antibiotics for my acne. I also change my pills. I have POCS. Recently I started to fill itchy, and I called my gyn, she told me that this outcome was expectable due to antibiotics. I went to the clinic, and she gave me a prescription. I went to the local pharmacy, they asked me for a printed version of the prescription, so I went back to my house and I asked my father to printed it for me. Since the only printer we have is in his office. After 5 minutes, he came to me, and start to yell at me. That I was practically a whore, that I got a STD. That I should be more careful cause I don't live alone, that I got thrush cause I was being promiscuous. Then my stepmother came along, I went to my room, and my father said that she should be careful, since I got an STD, and I could infect her since we use the same bathroom. 
I never felt more ashamed in my whole life, I try to tell him, that thrush in not an STD, I asked him \"if he did a research about it?\" He said, of course I did it, is a vaginal infection, so obviously you got it by having sex.
I had never discussed with my father about my sexual life before, but I felt so... humiliated. I asked \"Who do you think you are to question my sexual life? I have had just one sexual partner, who is my current bf. And I'm 24. Could you say the same thing? And candida is not an STD, is a common infection on women, most of the women will suffer it in any point of their lives. You're an ignorant, a dumb. And make sure what you're telling is right, before shouting out loud for the world to know it (he told my step mom I got an STD in the garden, well, didn't tell, he yelled at her). I told him, that he didn't even have a vagina, cause he insisted that thrush indeed was an STD, I said \"Don't you dare to mansplaining and tell me how my body works. I told him that he has two daughters, that in behalf of me, my step mom and my sister, he should educate himself more about this topics. He got mad, but I'm furious. I'm not pretending apologize to him. Now, my step mom is compulsively cleaning the bathroom. I not sure of I can transmitted by using the same toilet, but I've been disinfecting it, each time after I used it.

I'm feeling so mad, he ashamed me, and even if I had a very active sexual life, I don't think I deserve it. I can't believe than in 2021, men still think they have the right to think women are whores for having sex. I feel hurt, not only by my dad, but by my step mom that supported him.",2021-01-25T15:34:27.000Z,4

AskMen,theetam,How to deal with partner whom you've been virtually dating telling you that she avoids meeting you.,"Been dating a women virtually mostly whom I met during the Pandemic. Due to circumstances we've been not able to meet more than a couple of times the last few months. The first couple of dates were weird since I'm a bit socially awkward and I've had rejections previously where women mentioned that the in person vibe is different from my virtual vibe. When I was planning the next meet she mentioned that she tries to avoid meeting because she doesn't feel the in person connect yet and she's afraid that will ruin the connect we have on phone. She says this is on her because she's not used to dating like this and it's not me. 

I'm heartbroken hearing this and  I don't know what is the further path ahead. My self esteem is rock bottom because of the situation happening multiple times with women and I was really into her and we've been together for 8 months virtually. I can't stop thinking it's because of me. Advice please!",2021-01-25T15:46:56.000Z,33

Feminism,Smr5193,Biographies of women who have inspired you,"Hi.  This is probably an over-done topic and I don't want to come across as some sort of white knight who *just* discovered gender bias, but I thought this might be the best place to ask!

My partner and I wanted to read more biographies of inspiring women, so I went and did a little bit of research and was *shocked*. At the beginning of my research it was (dark)funny how every third male assistant to some deputy diplomat at some conference in history has ten engaging biographies written about him, yet in some cases, women who I *know* to have had incredibly cool and inspiring lives have no major works done about them (in biographical detail, I mean).

For example, I am super interested in the development in the ENIAC and especially in the role that   Jean Jennings Bartik, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum, Betty Snyder Holberton, Frances Bilas Spence, and Kay Mauchly Antonelli played in setting it up. If you google 'ENIAC girls' (I agree - the nickname is terrible) you can catch good chronicles here and there, and some minor works.  I suppose I was looking for more stuff like 'The Woman who Smashed Codes'.

The only historical books that come as top suggestions for the history of the ENIAC seem weirdly oblivious to this piece of its history: one of them ('ENIAC in Action') has a disappointingly perfunctory context on the importance of women to the project, and the other one ('Eniac: The Triumphs and Tragedies of the World's First Computer') seems to flat out paint it as a journey/creation of the two men at the top.

I'm not trying to say there aren't any good books about women in science. I really liked Code Girls, for example, but it lacked that intimacy that I really like of biographies. In that sense, I enjoyed Radium Girls more - but I was still wanting to read the journey of a hero.

Maybe I'm too new at researching this, so I just wanted to ask anyone for good suggestions that come to mind! Thanks.",2021-01-11T05:30:40.000Z,6

AskMen,Demirige,How do i stop sweating and smelling while fighting allergies?,"Hi everyone, ive been dealing with this issue for a while, sweating not just under armpits, but all over, also have a bad odour but ive fixed that.

Some context:

I cannot use everyday deodorants, cause im allergic, i start sneezing and get watery eyes if im too close to someone that wears a normal deodorant or if i put it on. Usually out in the open it doesnt matter. So i stumbled across [Native deodorant](https://www.nativecos.com/), this saved me cause i could smell good and it wouldnt effect my nose, cause it didnt have harsh chemicals. It doesnt stop sweating though. So what i did recently was go through all the every day deodorants + antipersperiants that im allergic to and note down their chemicals and search each and every chemical and see if its safe or if it can cause an allergic reaction. I used normal google search and [this website](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/). Then i found a solution for groin sweat, dont really smell there, just sweat a lot. I havent used it yet but it seems really good in comparison to normal baby powder: [Chassis](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B0167J6UVK/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2WFOLXH4D2VM1&amp;psc=1), im going to buy it soon, i also wondered if i could apply the powder round my torso or even under my arm pits so i asked them, still waiting for that email back. Also i usually sweat if i just go out sometimes from anxiety and social situations and sometimes cause its hot and i have no control over it. Im pretty sure i dont have hyper hidrosis, but i still sweat a lot round my torso and groin.  But rarely sweat if its winter and cold outside obviously, thats why i love winter lmao. I'm 20 and take care of myself in terms of diet and working out, so i ruled diet out for a reason of smelling bad. Also colognes are my kryptonite too. im from Australia, so sometimes some american websites that have a product i want to try the shipping costs more than the actual product lol.

My problem as a whole:

I want to stop sweating and smell good at the same time too. Ive heard of certain Dri and sweatblock, i havent tried them yet, cause i already used something similar which is okay, but i want to know if its worth getting those kinda of products and maybe put on a roll on deodorant on top of it the next day to smell nice aswell, has anyone done that?

 i want to use some sort of antiperspirant, but at the same time ive heard that if it contains aluminium, which most do, it can lead to breast cancer or something (Are there any alimunium free antiperspirants that also use safe and natural chemicals?). I also want to use some sort of scent to smell good, that doesnt affect my nose. I want to stop sweating so much and smell good in a natural way. I dont mind a little sweat, just dont wanna have pit stains or feel uncomfortable, when im out.

Other than that im going to a doctor soon, i asked about it a while ago, but i remember him saying you have to figure it out yourself cause everyones different, which makes sense, but it feels like i cant even use anything in the market out there nowadays.

Thanks for reading! Any help is appreciated.",2021-01-25T07:06:15.000Z,3

Feminism,Made_of_Lionesses,Marching On: The Top 5 Ways the Women’s March Improved our Country,"Yesterday marked the four-year anniversary of the Women’s March on January 21st, 2017. Looking back, it was truly amazing. Millions of women who had never considered themselves human rights defenders adopted a new title, Activist. They took to the streets and used their voices to fight for justice and equality. To honor their efforts and courage, here’s the top five ways how our country has become a better place four years on. 

**1. The Art**

From the Fearless Girl sculpture by Kristen Visbal to Matthew Chavez’s Union Square sticky notes of hope, the march offered inspiration to artists. For painters, writers and musicians, the march was their muse in creating socially relevant art. Billy Keane, of the band The Whiskey Treaty, wrote the anthem to the NYC Women’s March. “It was intended as a kind of battle cry. [*Hey Lady*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJMf7X_AGsQ) is a resounding call for solidarity and support for a cause long fought for,” said Keane. Creative souls, we appreciate you commemorating such an important event and movement.

[https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=iJMf7X\\_AGsQ ](https://preview.redd.it/ticqcimosvc61.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec2242fb58c7b3187c93dd1ea6a880e398aed14e)

**2. Representation**

With gender equality being fundamental for a sound government, the march encouraged more women to participate in the public sphere. Not only has the gender parity at public institutions improved but diversity has increased as well. AOC was the youngest Congresswomen ever elected, Sarah McBride the first trans Senator and our first Black/Asian VP, Kamala Harris! Cheers to the female leaders at decision-making bodies standing up for inclusive policy. 

**3. Allyship** 

Perhaps one the most valuable parts of the women’s rights equation is *men*. There is no unity without male education, commitment, and advocacy. The Women’s March provided an opportunity to have hard, yet useful conversations regarding the sexes. Daring discussions were had around unconscious bias, privilege, and gender roles. A big thank you to our gentlemen allies and change agents, we’re stronger together. 

**4. #MeToo**

Horrible men in the highest of places got called out and punished, like Harvey Weinstein. In many ways due to the march, women felt like they were not alone. They got introduced to a big support system, which made them feel safe in speaking out against sexual misconduct. To the brave victims who publicized their abuse/harassment and to Tarana Burke, Rose McGowan &amp; Alyssa Milano – You are angels for helping spread the message of survivors, we are eternally grateful. 

**5. Boss Ladies**

The march shined  a bright light on the need for additional women in power, among business leadership. Subsequently, a record number of women took over Fortune 500 companies. This has meant increased paid family leave and pay gap reduction. And for ladies run who their households full time, there’s been more reignition of their hard work, as well as further “sharing of the load.” Here’s to continued progress. 

Although most in-person marches are not happening this year due to the pandemic, you can visit [Women’s March](https://womensmarchglobal.org/) to get involved in the virtual mobilization and on the socials with #WeCount and #ForwardTogether.

AskMen,FryForFriRice,"How to have the guts/confidence to do things, react to situations faster and change my lazy life before its too late?","20 male, haven't got a job(trying), changed degrees (left the previous degree because wanted to give this degree a shot), only help certain household chores when called and not willing to learn other stuff (most of my time is spent on the computer and my dad isn't happy about it) 

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, I lived a decent and spoon-fed (parents gave me stuff, hoping that I learn something useful out of it) life. My family is not rich but food is the main priority before anything else. My dad says I haven't faced hardship ever in my life (his childhood wasn't good, had to work at a young age and migrated to another country in his 20-30s with nothing but his 2 nuts \\[his words\\]) and not willing to move and do stuff and do things slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore my hands shake when I hold something, move something and when I do a task I'm scared/nervous and don't have the guts to do it so I kinda half-ass it (don't know how to describe it) or and react to situations slowly, almost like daydreaming. Like when learning to park, my dad tells me I react too slow turning the steering wheel meant I can't get into the parking space. He says if I don't move and learn anything, then my hands are gonna be like this at the end of my 20s and my brain is not gonna be active.

I'm not sure if the trembling is because of the lack of moving and therefore terrible dexterity doing tasks.

I tried volunteering but my dad didn't like it (cause the event finished at midnight) and at one point I was considering for the military and he also didn't like it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I hate the way I'm living and want to change (I hate my parents nagging me regarding my lifestyle). I want to be able to do tasks or anything with guts/confidence, like if a task is given, I want to know what is going on and can execute the task with 99.999999% without fail, react to situations faster, not just on driving but everyday life, able to understand what steps I should take in a certain situation and flip a 180 on my life. 

I really don't want to regret in my 30s for not getting my shit together in my 20s",2021-01-16T10:29:13.000Z,9

AskMen,RampagingKoala,MOD POST: Why was the sub locked?,"Sup shitlords,

You may have noticed that the sub was locked recently. We'd like to tell you what happened, why we consider this issue resolved, and what we want to do in the future to prevent this from happening again.

**What Happened**

A mod had removed a series of comments and subsequently banned a user who was making inflammatory bigoted statements towards a user and even going as far as to harass this user via PM. All of these things are bannable offenses according to our rules. This banned user decided to report the moderator to the admins, who received a suspension that was likely determined by a bot. In protest and in support of the mod who was unfairly suspended, we locked the sub. We don't believe that bigoted, hateful statements should be tolerated on reddit, and if the admins are going to stand in support of hate, we won't make our sub a party to it.

Many of you who have visited our sub know that we stand at the precipice of many hateful communities whom shall remain nameless (they love pills and keep going their own way with strategies).  If reddit automation is going to prevent us from keeping this community a somewhat relatively okay place to discuss issues, then we would rather lock the community down than see it get dragged down to the tar pits we have tried incessantly to prevent it from being.

**Why do we consider this issue resolved?**

An admin has reached out to us without prompting, reversed the suspension, and taken action on our behalf. We would like to thank this admin for being engaged.

**What are we doing to prevent this from happening again?**

Honestly, nothing. We can't do anything here. We have asked for more direct communication with the admins on these issues, but we won't hesitate to lock the sub again if reddit shows that they are on the side of hate speech. We call on the admins to take a more direct approach of handling things, instead of relying on automation that prevents us from doing our jobs (but you do this fOr fReE).

We're going to lock comments on this because we don't really feel that this merits community discussion.

Have a great day,

The mods",2021-01-09T20:20:09.000Z,0

What happened?,"Aftter 5 years I'm done with my computer science degree and no offense to anyone but it's just not something I enjoy doing. But how do I go to my parents, who have paid all my expense for the 5 years and tell them I don't want to do this. Also career wise I'm 25 this year and \"wasting\" 5 more on something I think I'd like and starting a career when I'm 30 doesn't seem like a smart thing to do, and what if I find the new thing something I don't enjoy? Also how do I find that thing? Everything I seem to enjoy at the moment is more of an expensive hobby rather than something I can make a career of off.

If I were to have gone along with my plans I would have already had a years worth of experience. But now I have nothing to show for that choice. How the fuck do you manage the regret, frustration, and resentment that comes with this?

AskMen,Chartreuse-Mongoose,"Fathers who were abused by their dad, how did you history affect your ability to raise children?","TL;DR I want kids but I don't think I would be a good parent because of abuse perpetuated by my dad.

I'm not a great writer, so bear with me.

My dad was physically abusive to me for the vast majority of my life. Years of therapy have really helped me shape myself into the person that I want to be, and also learn exactly who that is. And I guess I'm someone who wants to have kids. 

I'm a 26 year old male. Maybe when I was 18-19, a couple years after the last time that my dad kicked the shit outta me, I had decided with absolute certainty that not only did I not want kids, but I could NEVER have kids. 

My dad was beaten nearly to death by my grandfather, and my grandfather was beaten by his dad, etc. My dad didn't speak to my grandfather for 25 years until the day he died because of this, but I talked to him a handful of times. 

My grandfather never wanted to hurt or even hit my dad, but he was so shackled to his trauma, and the rage that comes with it, because of his relationship with his dad. From what my mom told me my dad felt the same way regarding me. I can't confirm that because I broke off contact with him a while back. 

So why should I believe that I'm any different? I don't ever see me hitting my children in any possible future, but neither did they, and they still did. They perpetuated that cycle of abuse, and I don't know if I'm smart, strong, or capable enough to break it. As much as I want kids, I just don't see a future in which I can have them and be a good dad.

Even if you don't have advice on the matter, please share your story. Thank you.",2021-01-25T19:29:51.000Z,2

AskMen,johnysuomi,What is the best argument that not all women who take money for sex are hookers?,"Hei everyone,

My first post here. Thus question has been around my mind for some time &amp; I know it's weird. Since, my young [teen] age [35now] I had this weird thinking that noet all women who took money for sex are a hooker/prostitutes etc. Though, they fit the criteria &amp; meet the legal definition but I never believed that coz I thought most of them are needy &amp; have no other means to support their selves other than taking money for sex. I know it's not true &amp; many many women, esp young girls do this for maintaining their heavy duty life styles.

Now, when sugar dating or other similar dating services are available for everyone &amp; considering bad economic conditions, what will be the best argument for women taking money for sex &amp; not being hookers at the same time?

Please don't take this serious, I just want to know your thoughts. 

Thanks in advance.",2021-01-09T13:56:30.000Z,48

AskMen,Old-Aardvark,"I don't really want to have sex with my girlfriend, I feel bad but don't know what to do","Almost 3 years into the relationship. I still love her and enjoy being around her but definitely just generally don't feel as attracted to her. It's not like she gained weight or anything physically different (plus I've never had an issue with bigger women in the past, not trying to say that gaining weight always makes people unattractive)

There have been times in the past where she has been borderline abusive and had boundary issues like looking through my journal. However with the looking through my journal she did actually find things that I had been hiding from her (being bisexual, being uncertain about my relationship and if she's someone I want to be with at times, etc) and it honestly leads to us having conversations about some of these hard topics that I had been avoiding which helps us get closer so it feels hard for me to be mad about. Plus they were like 6 months to a year ago that it was actually a problem and she recognizes that she was wrong and an asshole to me and has been doing a good job of working on and improving

But yeah I don't know part of me feels like I'm fine with the relationship how it is and would be okay without sex really, I guess I just don't really feel like a lust towards her and sex feels like something I feel \"forced\" to do because I don't want her to feel unattractive or bad because I don't. Sometimes we have sex and I am into it but the most recent time (a few weeks ago) I just wasn't really feeling it and trying to do it our of obligation and couldn't get it up

I don't think that it is anything to do with asexuality because I can imagine having sex with someone else and getting into that just not as much with my girlfriend. I go on and off with porn, sometimes a week or two without then every day or so for a bit.

I know stopping masturbating is a good place to go and have for a few days, but it also just feels like forcing myself to do something that I'm generally just okay without and makes it hard to enjoy. I dont want to feel that way about someone that I'm supposed to be trying to build a life with but I just don't know what to do.",2021-01-29T22:21:42.000Z,47

AskMen,Any-Dream2719,What do you expect a girl to have done to get ready before you come over?,"This is a very stupid post but I thought some other perspectives might help calm my anxiety. I’m (22F) having a guy over for the first time. I’ve never done anything before, don’t even know how to kiss, and he is fully aware of this. We’re probably just going to watch a movie and cuddle, maybe make out depending on how the night goes. Is there anything that I should do to prepare for him? Obviously I’ve taken a shower and covered all of the hygiene stuff. I have fresh sheets and blankets, cleaned the kitchen and bathroom, and got a few snack things for tonight. Is there anything else I should get done?

Update: holy hell you guys! I never intended for this to go as crazy as it did. He should be here within an hour and will update tomorrow for those of you who are interested. Thank you for all of your comments, ideas, and positive thoughts!

Second update: I’m not sure how/where to post this so that everyone who was invested in my night can find it. Things went... ok. The spark just wasn’t there. I don’t know if it was because of my nervousness or just genuinely not a connection. Things also moved a lot quicker than I had anticipated. I specifically stated that I wanted to go slow, take small steps, literally just hang out and watch a movie and whatever happens, happens. Pretty soon I feel his hand under my shirt playing with my boobs. Whatever, don’t really care. Not even 5 seconds goes by before he’s on top of me asking if he can kiss me. I told him yes and his tongue *immediately* is down my throat. I tried to pull back a little but ultimately ended up in a slobbery mess. Sorry to disappoint the crazy number of you who commented and liked this post, just wasn’t the right guy.

Third update: good morning! I’m literally in tears at the amount of love, support, and concern so many of you have shown me. I had no idea my post would ever go this direction. I’m just adding this in for any clarification and for those who are now finding this. 

1) I’ve known this guy for almost a year. He’s (26) a mutual friend of mine and we recently started talking more seriously about a month ago. 

2) Since the first time he asked if he could come over (about 2 weeks ago), I have made it clear that I need to take things slow. I struggle with severe anxiety due to an abusive father. He knows this. He’s listed to me talk about things that I can’t do because of him. I thought I had made myself clear but I’m second guessing that now. 

3) Any remaining advice for how to do things differently in the future would be greatly appreciated!

Much love- S

4th update: well damn everyone. Front page and all, I’m honored haha. Never thought my first date would get me Reddit famous. For the few of you still invested, messaging me, or finding this post later on, I have a final ending for everyone. He messaged me earlier this afternoon just asking general convo questions. We finally got to talking about last night and I told him that I felt incredibly uncomfortable and things went too fast. He got pissed and told me I should’ve been “honored” that he even wanted to do anything with me. Told me that no one likes a prude and we should’ve just gone all the way to get it over with. Took a few screenshots and he’s now blocked. Thanks for everything, stick around if I ever get to dating someone ever again.",2021-01-29T21:02:46.000Z,1486

I’m not sure how many of you are familiar with what a ‘black country’ accent is but if you’ve watched Peaky Blinders, that’s pretty much it. Now onto the pronunciation problem itself, whenever I get to the letter ‘R’ whilst spelling something, it sounds like I’m vocalising the letter ‘A’ in a posh manner.

As a result, I have to add a bit of emphasis to the letter which makes me sound like a daft pirate. I really fucking hate this letter, does my head in. How the hell do you lads pronounce it without trying too hard?",2021-01-30T20:28:18.000Z,122

Feminism,anneliesvand,Are my parents right about this?,"Hi I am a 23 year old woman and feminist with a personal question.
I've got the opportunity to be a model for a body positivity, lgtbq+ friendly overall amazing underwear brand (La Fille D'O). The style of the photographer and also owner of the brand is very direct; with visible nipples, hair and everything.

I am an artist myself and my work is very much about the female experience especially about sexualization of our body. I go completely nude for my own photography, paintings and performance all the time. So even without this shoot my body is out there, in a direct way.

I told my parents the news I would be doing this shoot. They had no problem with me modelling as a lingerie model, but they have a problem with this brand because it is too nude, too direct, overall not pretty. They came with the following arguments;

- what would the rest of my family think?

- What if I needed another job which won't appreciate the nudity?

- I would make their life harder by doing this shoot because they would have to face my family and, wait for it, their colleagues. My father even fears losing his job because of these hypothetical pictures.

This last one really stuck with me. Aren't they just making me feel guilty for living my life, which I try to live in an empowering way?

I am wondering what you think? Is there any way I would really be such a burden? Is this a valid reason for a 23 year old to feel guilty, maybe even hesitating doing the shoot to begin with.



I hope this is the right place to ask this. Thanks!",2021-01-13T18:59:12.000Z,14

AskMen,NachtschreckenDE,How to prevent oily hands?,"I'm 21 and noticing on my new Laptop (I want to keep clean of course) that it gets dirty very fast. Mostly oily dirt I can easily wipe away but after gaming for a few hours or writing an essay it looks terrible. Its not due to the keys since my phone screen and other things are also very dirty compared to others.

I knew I have oily hands before but this makes me feel uncomfortable.

I'm washing my hands regularly but even this leads to condensation on mouse and palm rest (really trying to rub them dry) and after this it starts getting muddy again.

Does anyone with oily hands has tips to prevent things from getting too dirty?
I tried baby powder, teabags and as mentioned washing regularly.",2021-01-04T22:53:05.000Z,6

AskMen,EarlyExcitement4338,Are friends with benefits ever a good idea?,"Sorry if this is too long. So a friend of a friend that I’ve known for a while recently moved back to town and over the summer we started flirting and texting . He got nervous and thought I wanted something serious even though I never insinuated that. He told me he had a lot of baggage and basically “it’s not you it’s me”. After a few weeks, I suggested us being friends with benefits which is so unlike me but sex with him is great. We’ve been doing this for a few months now. One day of the week every week we watch movies, drink and are intimate. I don’t text him over the week, only the day prior or the day of seeing him. When we do text though it’s thoughtful and kind on both ends. He treats me with respect and when we are alone we have a strong attraction/connection. Both mentally and physically . Alright, sorry again for being so wordy. I’m 29 and he’s 38. I know I want to settle down one day and get married. He definitely has baggage and now he confides in me and tells me the fucked up life he’s had. Honestly just makes me like him more because normal people bore me and life hasn’t been a cake walk for me either. Welp I’ve caught the feelings and think about him often. I really don’t want to end this because I’m becoming attached. Is it possible or likely that he could too get attached and just needs more time? Or is this him having his cake and eating it too? Is there anyone on this forum that has done friends with benefits before and if so what’s your experience?",2021-01-18T17:53:20.000Z,18

AskMen,OAIII5,"To the single dads out there , how do you do it?","Recently split with my ex of 9 years . We have 3 kids .
I'm now living alone struggling financially, emotionally and mentally 

Coming home to nothing and no one is so hard 
And the defening silence eats at me . I can't tell you how much I miss \"daddys home !\" And the kids running around and playing 

I love my kids to death but I'm struggling with thoughts . I'm in a very dark place right now 

I don't have any friends , made choices to prioritize my kids and partner as well as work which left no time for friends .

As for other family , none 

I had my kids and my ex , they were my world and I feel like I have lost them . 

I'm still trying to see them as much as possible but I feel I failed as a parent and as a man .

I want to see them but I don't want them to see me like this .

Sometimes I feel like I'm just being a bitch and I need to man up but sometimes I can't,  it feels like I'm choking. 

I can't have been the only person who is going through something like this or has in the past .

How do I as a man get through this ?",2021-01-12T23:45:00.000Z,44

AskMen,LaDolphin,"Gentlemen, how do you deal with a shitty boss?","I work for the government as an engineer, and the management at my current position is just terrible:
  
* When I was offered the position, the senior manager said that it should be no problem to promote me once I meet the experience requirements a month after starting. I turned down another position that was offering the same promotion to take this job. They refused to give me the promotion until 6 months after working.
    
* Speaking of our senior manager, he is always in his office with his door shut, constantly complaining and talking shit about something or someone. 
  
* During the pandemic, most people are working from home. We have the capabilities to work from home too, but we continue to work from the office.
  
* Our direct supervisor sometimes gives us tight, arbitrary deadlines for tasks that do not actually need deadlines. We already have a continuous, never-ending load of work on our plates and the deadlines just unnecessarily stress us out. 
  
* When we go out to do field work, we have to let the direct supervisor know before we leave. If we are doing design work, we send him a field log of each day, how many locations we've visited, and the times of our pictures. He checks these times to make sure that we're consistently working and not taking extra long breaks, and questions us about our day if he feels something is up. There are multiple times when he has contacted me to ask me when I'm coming back to the office not because he needs me at the office for anything, but just because he is wondering why I am out in the field 30 minutes longer than he estimated. We've all been working there for a year and don't steal company time, yet he still feels the need to Big Brother us.
  
* Micromanagement. We do project management, and can't be trusted to manage these projects on our own without the direct supervisor chiming in on most e-mail responses and what action we should take. We have to CC him on every e-mail. A good portion of the e-mails I send related to my projects have to be reviewed by the direct supervisor first. I produce good work, so this just feels belittling.
  
* One of our team members straight up quit without another job lined up.
  
This is the first shitty management I've had and I'm having trouble dealing with it. I know I should just be a good boy and just take the abuse until I can find a new job, but sometimes it festers and I lash out. Any ways to let the frustration out in a healthier way?",2021-01-24T23:35:07.000Z,9

I’m not one that has got many girls over the years, and I consider myself a pretty nice guy to girls.

I considered that ‘nice guys’ are perceived to be less successful with girls, and pondered whether I’m using it as an excuse for not getting girls because that’s not what girls like. 

For instance, when I talk to a girl I don’t particularly find attractive, I’m a lot less attentive to what they’re saying as opposed to someone I’m attracted to.

I think it’s probably the truth, considering the ‘nice guys’ thing is most probably a myth.

 The Ugly Truth is that girls do like ‘nice guys’, and I may not even be a nice guy, but have been hiding behind that façade for years.",2021-01-24T23:49:39.000Z,27

I think it's pretty distasteful that such comments are usually, from what I can tell, socially accepted if being thrown out by a woman.

I personally can feel inadequate because of comments like this and have a hard time separating bad person and bad culture among women.

How do you navigate such a toxic environment without being discouraged when looking for a partner?

What should I look for when buying a lawnmower? I've had a look but I've ben inundated with information. My lawn is such:

\\- I live in New Zealand

\\- 600m2 (\\~6450sqft)

\\- Gently sloping

\\- There are some trees

I'm hoping someone can advise on a mower that will stand the test of time, be in a modest budget range and doesn't have to be specific, more like \"go for a mower over a certain cc\" or \"steer away from electric because...\"

All helps appreciated, cheers!",2021-01-06T02:12:24.000Z,17

AskMen,ButtLaser5000,"Single too long, how do you deal with it when starting anew?","So, I've encountered something a bit weird lately. I started talking to someone lately in the hopes of starting something new, but was asked the question 

\"how long have you been single?\"

I guess I was slightly taken aback by the question, because I hadn't really thought about it, but I've been \"officially\" single since late 2015. My ex and I still saw each other off an on for about a year after, and talked occasionally until 2018. That's a whole other story and the last thing I want to do is talk about my ex with someone new. Granted there were a couple things that never really panned out here and there with other people since 2015, but I wouldn't ever really say that I wasn't \"single\" at any point. My life has been strange, and I guess I never found it really surprising that I was single. I moved to drastically different countries twice since then and each time have had to start from scratch in a social sense.Granted, I didn't elaborate as I did just now and just said \"late 2015\".

She seemed sort of dismayed by my answer. It seems so often that the women I know are single for relatively short periods of time, that it seems bizarre to them that I'm past the 5 year mark on being single. I've often found myself in situations during my times abroad that I've developed more casual relationships and occasional flings, but that never sounds good when you try to explain it to someone you desire a serious relationship with. I'm wondering if anyone else has been dealing with anything similar when meeting someone new after a long period of being single.",2021-01-11T09:04:42.000Z,7

AskMen,10pumpsclassic,"Men, what does your laundry routine look like?","As a guy, I often don't separate colors, or fabrics. I don't work a job where my clothes get super sullied or dirtied. I just put everything in one load, and typically do it after about a week to week and a half. This includes my going out clothes, socks, boxers, t-shirts, pillow covers, as well as sweats and any workout material. 

I feel I'm not doing it correctly because ideally I want my clothes to last, but I also want to be hygienic. I don't typically wash my jeans or denim, as I air dry them, but will wash them after about 50 to 60 wears, but I have enough to last a week or longer, so I'm really only wearing them each after about 8 or 9 wears in-between.

So, as a male, what's the best way to do laundry, for someone who doesn't have it in his apartment? I don't have the luxury of having it in my disposal and require a big grocery shopping cart to lift and lug around.

This usually means I have to often plan out my clothes and as silly as this sounds, do laundry on odd days, either immediately after work, or on Friday nights. But also plan out so I have \"just enough\" for the load machine. 

I know life is more then a pair of dirty laundry, and one can argue that you should just have enough socks and boxers to last a month or two months, but I've never needed that many. I try to be minimalistic when I can, environment-friendly where I can, and do my part.

Ideally, I'd like to do my laundry after two weeks, but not after a week, as I feel it's too soon.

Am I overthinking laundry? How much do you spend per week or what's your routine look like? How often is your cycles? Do you split or just throw them in all one load?

What's the best way to also save money on laundry? Any detergent saving hacks, or tips and techniques one can share?

I should also add, I'm unemployed due to the pandemic, and don't go out often anymore, unless for errands and groceries, but can still pretty much apply for when I do have a job.

So im 28, i have a degree in secondary education, but not state certification. Why? Well quite honestly im a horrible standardized test taker. I still work in education however as a GED teacher for a non profit and recent took a second job teaching GED night courses 3 days a week at a local college.


I recently bought a 4 bedroom townhome my wife (married 2 years ago) After upgrading from a shitty appartment. 

My wife and I make decent money, can easily afford bills plus can live well in our means (wife works with special need children).

We have insurance, we pay our bills, we want to start a family and yet...i feel like a faillure.

I have 3 sisters, one is a private speech therapist with w doctor husband in NYC, the other just her masters in child psych, and my younger sister is getting her degree in communications.

All or them are on thier way to be making about a crap ton of money and live great lives and here I am with my shitty, mediocrity of a live.

Normally a man would talk to his father about feelings like this right? Nope. Dad left when i was 16 haven't seen him since.

My mom keeps comparing me to how we lived. ( when dad was around-the-clock we lived well, cruises, disney world, paris one year) but since he left i was deemed tge man lf the house and took care of everything. Car issues, computers, plumbing, being the emotional anchor for my mom and sisters

Am i just holding myself to too high a standard? Could i be doing more?

I want to be happy with my life, but i feel like i failed as a husband, son, and a man",2021-01-16T15:51:22.000Z,12

AskMen,AWildGamerAppeared25,How do I have a good relationship with my dad?,"On mobile, sorry for formatting in advance 

My dad is... My dad. It's always been hard to have a good relationship with him, as I was basically raised by my grandma and then my mom when she didn't work/wasn't sick. 

He's a doctor who had some time in the military, so he's always been very strict and doesn't express his feelings too well (and neither do I). He's been somewhat emotionally abusive, most likely without meaning it - he'd tease me for things when growing up; I was the one babysitting my siblings when they'd be at work, I had to do chores and my homework, be a good student etc, and will always get in trouble if something was done wrong, whatever. 

I feel like he's been way more lax with my siblings than with me, specially now that I'm about to graduate from a 4yr college. I'm always talked about how I handle my money poorly (which I kinda do, but I'm learning at my own pace. Always being broke does that to you lol) - my gaming as basically my only hobby, my relationships, etc. 

Every time my dad calls me, it turns into a 30-60 minute lecture of *something*, and eventually I just sit there basically saying \"yeah\" \"okay\" \"mm-hmm\".

Yet my siblings are basically on the Xbox or on their laptops 24/7. If my sister wants Chinese, they'll go to the buffet, if my brother wants some snacks, they'll go buy them - even when they don't clean at home, do the dishes, etc. 
My brother is basically failing middle school classes left and right, and they went to California to see family for Christmas ( I was invited, but wasn't told in time to get time off work and I didn't really wanna go cause covid). 

I just feel like I'm the only one who's supposed to do things \"right\" and it's always my dad who'll set up these standards. I can have conversations with my mom or grandma, but never with my dad - it always turns into a lecture somehow and I just can't take it so I don't talk to him 

I love him, he's my dad - and he's sacrificed a *lot* for us my siblings, my mom and me. But I can't ignore basically everything I've said already 

I used to dislike hearing I look so much like him, because I don't want to be like him - he'd be super nice to everyone but be mean and hypocritical to us, his family. Just so many things that are hypocritical and seem wrong to me. 

So, after that whole rant lol... How do I go about trying to fix / work on this relationship for those who have/had bad relationships with their dad?",2021-01-23T15:02:47.000Z,37

AskMen,Addonhiram,How do you deal with your crush avoiding you at work?,"Hello, this  woman at work, she's just starting to open up to me after months of me  trying to show her interest. The thing is, everything is going on in  private chat when we bump each other at work. We could talk for a while  and not get bored. I like her and i've told her a bunch of times she's  pretty.

But  she seems very weird around colleagues, she almost never speaks to me  around them, acts like i don't exist. Ignores me when i say hi or in a  group never reacts on what i say or reply or looks at me. She  immediately purposely tries to intensify the chat with the other  colleague if i join in. And this happens all the time.

This  strange behaviour reminds me of a primitive childhood colleague  situation when a girl from school did this, and i've found out later  they were all hating me and discussing me on my back after some strange  bullying events. This sounds pathological in the current situation, as  we are not children.

The  thing is, I'm at a point where i've passed the small talk and i've told  her in her face i like her and i want more but she doesn't take me  serious because i'm 10 years younger, always trying to act busy or  changing the subject. I asked her out once and she said something like  'who knows what people will think around here' (the rest of the  colleagues).

Maybe she is ashamed of her age (40) being single and not courted by men her own age?

How  do i get past this blockage and how do i even know she's interested ?

Should i just ask her straight in the face about this behaviour?",2021-01-26T15:22:37.000Z,24

I was told my unability to gain weight could come from the genetic side (so far, a richer diet doesn't help, and exercise isn't rewarding much) and that my overall thinness could come from my past (was bullied for 5 years by a whole school and family decided they couldn't care less - not my problem type of reaction).

I lost my job as part of the COVID-19 pandemic back in October. This is and has been the longest stretch of time for me without work. I know in the grand scheme of things, it's really not that long, but it's been a while since I've seen a paycheck.

Every night, before I lay my head down on the canvas to sleep, I just think about my day. I've very rarely left the home, I'm typically in sweats or pajamas all day, and it's been very lonely for me.

I don't think I'm doing this life thing very well. I have no friends, I have very little ambition, and not a lot of things have been going on in my life.

Am I justified in how I feel? I thought I would be much further in my life, especially for this age I am.

AskMen,ZorakZorka,How Do You Become Independent and Self-Grounded?,"Over the past couple of years (I am now almost 24) I have made a lot of progress in my life. I have improved my financial situation a lot, I improved my love and sex life, I had a great lifestyle, I improved my fitness etc. But there is one thing that I could never improve or fix. The feeling of groundedness and self-worth.

I might be more successful than someone and better looking but I feel like my \"frame\" is very weak compared to most guys. It works fine with girls / women but with fellow man I feel like my sense of self-worth and my confidence is weak and faking a strong frame makes things worse. I need to build an authentic strong confidence.

Some unsuccessful, average-looking guys that don't have sex at all, have a much stronger sense of self-worth and a much stronger frame than me. I guess I am some sort of people pleaser. Not in the sense that I am nice all the time (I am not a very nice person) but in the sense that I am constantly looking for approval and respect from other men. I am full of insecurities.

Other men seem to just be at peace with themselves and not doubting their self-worth all the time. I on the other hand am constantly evaluating my self-worth. \"Am I successful enough?\" \"Do I have enough friends?\" \"Do I have enough sex?\" \"Is my life exciting enough?\" And even when the answer to all those questions is yes, I am constantly afraid to lose friends and status and lifestyle quality.

So my concrete question is: Do you guys have any advice as to how I can become more independent and build a stronger sense of self-worth and groundedness? How can I build an authentic strong frame. The usual advice like build a business, go after goals etc. doesn't work. I am already doing this successfully. I think this is a deeper thing. How can I develop the sense that I am enough but at the same time engage in the social game?

I appreciate every advice!",2021-01-20T18:18:50.000Z,14

AskMen,[deleted],How to go about a clothing style change,"Hi! I'm currently a senior in college who goes about everyday in athleisure. I'm a college athlete so most of my clothes come from my athletic team and I just bum around in those clothes day to day. I don't really have any desire to change my appearance for anyone else and I'm not looking to impress anyone, I just want to change up my closet so I'm not wearing the same sweats every day. 

I read a lot about those who go for fitted clothes and I'm not sure how to go about finding the right clothes for my body. I'm 6'2 and about 175 pounds. This leads me to getting stressed out when looking for new styles cause I have no clue what fits nice except for anything athletic. I'm looking to go more business casual as I have a job lined up post grad but have zero clothes to show up to work in. Any advice would be very appreciative and I hope you all are having a great week so far. Thanks!",2021-01-26T20:34:36.000Z,15

AskMen,10pumpsclassic,How do you come to grips with the reality of life?,"How are you? I understand this isn't the place for meaningful or deep conversation, but something has been marinating in my mind, and I'd like to get another person's input and opinions, and if I may, a variety of them.. 

But before I begin, some background and backstory.

They say you fully understand and grow to know yourself at 26, that you somehow start to peak, and therefore, it all goes downhill from here. I'm not sure how true that sentiment is, but with a few weeks before I turn 27, I have grown a bit more nervous and apprehensive about finding my way and purpose in life.

There are things I enjoy and things I know I'm not good at, no doubt. But as with all regularities, I tend to overthink these types of events, for example, how do I know if I'm not really that good at something versus not just having given it extra time and practice? Another thing is how do I find what I should be doing? How does one even find their true passion, really? 

This is a hard thing for me to fathom and come to grips with, because I've always tried to live a care-free life. I'm not sure what the heck it is I'm really doing, to be honest. I'm like a rift-raft in the ocean, with no direction or destination, just idly paddling, desperately looking for shore. Every opportunity or good fortune my way has sort of been the culmination of those before me, of being in the right place, in the right time.

I have a hard time believing I achieved anything solely out of merit. And if anything does end up my way, I typically find myself playing out two alternate scenarios in my mind, deciphering which path is the better one for me. In reality though, I've only ever done or partaked in things if it meant that I would somehow be better off either now or in the future.

So, that brings me to today. I'm unsure what to do next. I have no prospects, no offers, no pursuents, and no passion. No idea what to do, and no idea how to find out. 

Like a lame duck, I sit here wondering and pondering what to do. Things of course could change in a matter of a few weeks, or certainly next year, but without knowing that prophecy, and not being a believer of big fallacies, how does one find their calling and passion? 

Would love to hear from some of you if you feel the same way and have found life's calling, or if you haven't, how you're coping with this state of limbo. 

Thanks for reading, thanks for listening.",2021-01-23T20:32:10.000Z,3
