AskMen,MD564,How do I help someone through ghosts of childhood trauma?,"I've (27f) started dating one of my best friends (27m) and everything is going great, he is so attentive but I'm worried about his mental well-being. He suffered a lot of physical and mental abuse as well as severe neglect from his parents as a child/teen, he'd often come to school without food and sometimes he'd have to sleep in his garden shed (we went to school together so as a teen I witnessed these things.)
When he's drunk he tells me nobody has ever loved him and he's used to not being wanted, but he hates talking about any of it sober. I always tell him that I'm so proud of him and how much I admire everything he is, but I don't think it's enough. 
I'm scared it could rear it's head in other unhealthy ways in our future together.

AskMen,NPC_Energy5,How do you get rid of side stitches?,"I‚Äôm a 14yo basketball player, and to keep it brief- I‚Äôve been getting these pains in my sides ever since I can remember.

It‚Äôs a stabbing pain in my lower front abdomen, it‚Äôs varying to both sides (maybe for different reasons I don‚Äôt know). I get them whenever I do any sort of running or cardio (like jumping jacks), and there‚Äôs no getting rid of them- only for temporary periods if I stretch it out and run really carefully. 
 

Recently I‚Äôve learned that there is this thing called side stitches which matches my little symptoms, I was wondering if there was any other guys who has/ had these? And how did you deal with them?


Edit: I wouldn‚Äôt guess that it‚Äôs medically serious, since it has never really affected me outside of sports or cardio or whatever- kind of like a stabby cramp",2021-01-04T21:28:15.000Z,21

AskMen,Huootak,How to gain glans sensitivity ?,"Hello Everyone,   
So i've searched about it, but everything i found was about guy that couldn't ejaculate because they didn't feel anything  
I do ejaculate quickly (premature actually), but i don't feel anything.  


TLDR, i don't really notice when i'm in my girlfriend or not, some of you may say \"maybe her vagina is too big for me, well even when she give me head, i can't feel her tongue on my glans, sometimes i feel her finger if she stroke with a thight hand but that's all  


It's kinda making the couple life complicated cause she is worry that i don't take pleasure during sex outside ejaculation.  


It may have been from bad masturbation habbits, i'm 26 and she is my first girlfriend, i masturbated a lot before her  


So, is there a way to regain glans sensitivity ? I read about moisturing the glans with hydrating cream, but so far no good.  


Thanks a lot for everyone willling to give advice !  


(don't know if relevant but, like i say i have premature ejaculation, even tho i don't feel pleasure until edging, it takes me 30s-ish to come close to orgasm, and if i do a wecond round, then i can last 5--10minutes, which i'm okay with, so i don't know if it's my glans that don't feel anything, or my brain that don't receive the information, since i do ejaculate quickly)",2021-01-04T18:05:40.000Z,14

AskMen,Tandril91,How do you talk to someone past casual politeness?,"I‚Äôd just like to start off by saying I‚Äôm 22 and I haven‚Äôt dated ever in my life, never had any sort of romantic or intimate interaction before. Years ago I told myself I would wait until I was emotionally, mentally and financially mature enough due to seeing how dramatic high school relationships were. 

So I‚Äôll sometimes find myself talking with a girl or two at work or on occasion one of my sister‚Äôs friends. I have this very stupid, chronic thought process when it comes to mind with women about what it‚Äôd be like to date them. We‚Äôll engage in some light small talk about how our days are but that‚Äôs pretty much it. I‚Äôm a massive moron when it comes to conversation, even with family I‚Äôve known for years. Beyond the basic, ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù, ‚Äúhaving a good day?‚Äù, and other such formalities I have trouble really just talking about anything. I‚Äôve no clue what to ask, say or bring up at any time. 

I‚Äôd love to just let loose and feel more casual around a girl, be able to joke and have some little rapport, rather than just treating them like a stranger every time. I‚Äôll essentially just give little polite responses when they start talking about something. ‚ÄúOh yeah? That‚Äôs pretty cool!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou did? That‚Äôs great!‚Äù ‚ÄúAw I‚Äôm sorry to hear that.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat sounds like a good idea.‚Äù 

These and other such phrases seem to be the majority of what I contribute to conversations. I don‚Äôt know how to question them in order to learn more about them. I‚Äôll sometimes try ‚Äúyou go to school?‚Äù, only to realize I know nothing about college so I don‚Äôt know what sort of specific questions to ask because it‚Äôll all go over my head and I‚Äôll just be sitting there nodding along, trying not to seem rude. 

I‚Äôm often left thinking: am I really interested in a woman? Or just the idea of one? Or maybe I‚Äôm subconsciously an asshole and just find them pretty to look at? I don‚Äôt even know what I want anymore, I...I have no clue why I‚Äôm pursuing something like this, I know it‚Äôll end in futility. 

Just thought I‚Äôd ask if y‚Äôall had any similar issues with this, or what you might recommend. Though I‚Äôll probably get it wrong anyway.",2021-01-26T05:23:06.000Z,32

It is true that in many cases, especially in music, that women don't entirely have a choice. 

The main conversation I've had, especially with my sister is Nicki Minaj and the rap industry in general, her arguing that she would have never gotten where she is today if she hadn't used her body or posed sexually.

Early December I went an entire week without even thinking about it, that's my best so far, the longest I've gone without doing it. 

I would very much appreciate and enjoy hearing some of your opinions on this.

How often should a 17 year old, male masturbate(and edjactulate)? 

Do you have any tips for distracting yourself and holding off from doing it?

But I was thinking, if I lost my belly fat, it would be nice to not spend most of my day sucking in my gut, or not trying to hide it with my hands when I‚Äôm sitting. 

But what about guys who never had much of a gut? Are you ever sensitive about it? Do you ever hide your belly or try to suck it in during your daily life?

EDIT: thanks for your comments so far. Please note that I‚Äôm not asking on how to loose a gut, just asking about how guys without a gut perceive their own bellies. Please no more comments about ‚Äúeating less food‚Äù or ‚Äúexercising more‚Äù

Additionally, guys with bellies: have any of you grown up confident about your bellies and have never had to worry about a stigma of ‚ÄúI need to be sucking it in?‚Äù",2021-01-27T18:48:25.000Z,26

Feminism,JackieNaper1907,Why is marriage seen as good for women and painful for men?,"I've always wondered this. In pop culture marriage is always depicted as something men are running away from and as something that women want. Historically, marriage has benefitted men, as they gained someone to do hours of unpaid labor for them and produce heirs. Even in modern day society, women still do around 2 more hours of unpaid labor then men PER DAY. This is even after working the same hours at work. Women's careers stall after giving birth while men's careers flourish. 

So why is marriage depicted as a prison for men and not women?",2021-01-15T11:12:22.000Z,31

And I would say he proves the power of the serious  study of history by his forecast.

This is just amazing to me because finally, the disgusting behaviour of many men on dating sites is being talked about amongst everyone, not just the women who have to go through it. And it's bringing so many horrible attitudes coming out of the woodwork. 

Almost all the FB comments are along the lines of: \"These same types keep chasing \\[football\\] players and then cry when rejected\", \"They obviously were ok with some attention to give out their number, why not just say not interested and block the number\" and all the usual crap about her seeking attention so she can get on reality TV shows/money.

AskMen,gearhead5015,How do you balance a demanding career with being a father and husband?,"My wife and I (32M) had our first child last year (thankfully 3 weeks before all hell broke loose about COVID). 

Additionally, I work at a Tier 1 Automotive Supplier as a Program Manager which can be extremely demanding from both the amount of hours worked and travel required. I don't love my job, and mostly it's because of my manager, but otherwise it pays very well and I really enjoy the people I work with and the program I get to work on (there's a lot of pride in my work considering I'm a car guy and I'm currently responsible for a very well known nameplate). 

For reference, 2019 was my busiest year to date and I traveled 50% throughout the year. The first 7 months I was gone every week for at least 2 days a week (overnight trips). Jan and Feb I traveled every week the entire week and including some Saturdays or late Sunday night drives to the plants. Thankfully all that tapered off towards the end of year, but that's about normal for launch during a program. 

That all being said, how do other people manage not completely ignoring their spouse and kids with a demanding job? 

Looking for advice as I don't want to wake up one day realizing my daughter will be turning 16 and full of regret for not being there.

Edit: An important tid bit, I don't plan on doing this job until I retire. My current track has us being completely debt free (house and all) before 2025 provided I don't have to make a move this year. Once that happens, our need for a great income is significantly reduced.",2021-01-06T13:40:53.000Z,15

AskMen,Felixdapussycat,How Do I Overcome My Irrational Fear of Bird Poop? (Germaphobia),"Long story short, I'm a serious germaphobe.  

  
 

A quick analogy: Imagine your parent/spouse/friend walked out of the house to grab something from the mailbox, but in front of the mailbox was a large piece of dog feces. Then without noticing, they stepped on the feces, walked back into the house, and started walking around spreading the poop across the house.  

That's what happens to me. Except in my case, it's bird poop. At my local Smart and Final parking lot (Where my parents usually go three times a month), at my grandmother's house, and on nearly every major street in my city, we got hundreds of birds and hundreds of poops.  

  
 

Basically, they look like the top images of these floors covered in poop. That's what I see here on a regular basis.  

Just Google, \"bird poop on the floor\" to get an idea of what I'm talking about.  
 

Luckily my parents don't wear shoes in the house (we all remove than at the entry of our home) but it still bothers me whenever they walk to the entry to look outside or pick up a package. Technically they are stepping on the areas where their shoes would normally step and then spread the germs and bacteria across the house. For this reason, I always find myself using disinfectant sprays and Clorox wipes to clean the entryways, sometimes the entire patio. For some reason, I can't stand the thought of bird poop being spread across the house.  

I want to get over my irrational fear, but admittedly, I'm going to be moving into my own place in a few months anyway, so maybe I shouldn't even bother? Honestly, as long as no shoes are worn in the house, I'm okay. And living by myself, I know that I wouldn't be wearing any shoes in the house anyway.",2021-01-22T18:35:47.000Z,11

And I agree - it must be really difficult to live with something so out of your control. 

But then I thought about it - I don't know any truly ugly people. There are loads of people who aren't \"my type\" or outside of my social circle (older than me, younger than me, have wildly different interests) but none of these people is ugly. And indeed, even guys I am really turned off by visually, have wives and kids or are actively dating. I've been in lockdown for a long time now, but I've been networking, and again, not once have I been on a zoom call and thought \"Geeze, turn your camera off mate, no-one wants to see that\".

It doesn't matter who the person is, friend or not friend, I'll always be there and try to help them whenever I can if possible, even if I end up being used. People have always told me that I was being too nice to them and I've just decided to ignore it I guess.
I'm starting to think that it might be also affecting, negatively, my relationships in general (friends, people I've breifely met, etc) and it kinda sucks.
I've been thinking quite a lot lately if I'm actually a \"nice guy\" or just a actual nice guy that should stop being too nice to people.

Acquaintance to me is somebody I‚Äôm friendly with and can even be pretty close to - but we see each other out of convenience (at work, at the gym). We don‚Äôt or rarely see each other outside of the convenient spot.

Friend to me is, I can call you at 3am if my cars broken down and you‚Äôll come without question (and vice versa). Extreme scenario but you get my drift.

AskMen,sunflowerfields14,How do you encourage a man without going into ‚Äúnagging‚Äù territory ?,"Bit of backstory: my boyfriend wants to be an electrician but has been knocked down every step of the way.

Short storyline:

-Go to college and get qualifications for a guaranteed apprenticeship? Sorry, the apprenticeship advisor doesn‚Äôt remember you.

-Go about and ask local electricians for any apprenticeships? Sorry, you need a car and a license.

-Work at a shit warehouse to make money to do your driving lessons and get a car? Sorry, COVIDs here, your test is cancelled and rebooked 4 times.

-Finally pass and get a car and license? Sorry, lockdown 3 has happened, all applications have been pulled, apprentices have been made redundant, theres a recession

He‚Äôs feeling down and burnt out but I know hope isn‚Äôt lost yet. I keep finding more local electricians, asking about, encouraging him to send details over to them even if they aren‚Äôt hiring, but every time I mention it he tells me to stop, he knows, to stop making it seem like he isn‚Äôt trying.

I know he is trying but I want to help any way I can. How can I do this without ‚Äúnagging‚Äù or making him feel like I don‚Äôt believe in him? Or should I kick him up the arse more ü§£ (just kidding)

AskMen,Tommate1985,Meat and fat cooking enthusiast husband has gained a lot of weight. How do I get through to him? He‚Äôs at higher risk of covid.,"He has gained quite a lot of weight since March. He hasn't stepped on the scale but it is very visible. He has a gut when he didn't previously and he looks heavier. It worries me because he works from home. He's doing the cooking. He's not exercising. He‚Äôs an ex smoker and HIV+.

I work and come home late and I am unable to cook for us so it's usually his cooking that we eat. Which is quite fattening because he likes to believe he's a chef. I have suggested healthier meals and he does cook those but that one dinner meal won't affect much. It‚Äôs very meat and fat heavy.

To give you an idea of his cooking. He finds recipes online that are very indulgent and much more suited for a special meal.

Fried ravioli. Chicken parm with cheese stuffed chicken. Cakes. Homemade donuts. Muffins on the daily. Big two portion steak meals that he eats for himself. Lasagna with a lot of meat and cheese. It‚Äôs all heartburn inducing.

Cooking and baking are his hobbies and I get that‚Äôs he‚Äôs stuck at home and enjoying doing his hobbies but it‚Äôs worrying. 

He's  positive and according to his doctor that's not a risk but I still worry a lot. Although I get tested regularly through my employer I am always sick with worry that I'll be coming him and bringing in the virus. We had a friend not much older than us who was obese pass away from covid.

I have had the heart to heart with him and straight up told him that he has to focus on his health a bit more. He minimised the issue and said he is still within the healthy range, I am sure he is not. He also took it wrong and turned it into a fitness issue. He's now thinking that I am upset about him not looking chiseled and with a 6 pack because he used to be quite fit. I am not that body type either and I have re-expressed that it is about his health.

How do I get through to him?",2021-01-18T23:09:41.000Z,78

So I am a straight male, who has read enough about the male g-spot resulting in me experimenting a few times ‚Äúback there‚Äù with toys and fingers and I have some questions.

1.	What should the sensation feel like? Like the actual penetration is an interesting sensation, and I believe it does feel good, but nothing that I would equate to orgasmic
2.	After reading online I believe that I found my prostate when doing this, and spent time massaging it and while I do get semi erect and it feels okay, nothing that really would be similar to an orgasm or a release
3.	After like 10-15 minutes of stimulation again it feels okay, however I can‚Äôt help but feel like I am doing it wrong.
4.	Is there such a thing as a g-spot orgasm, and without it being a weird question...what was it like, was it clear that was what was happening?

I am really just trying figure out if I am doing it wrong, or if like, I am doing it right, and it might not be for me.

Thanks",2021-01-13T04:08:30.000Z,9

Should mister Red take actions in that moment, knowing that he is actually telling a woman how to act because of a higher moral purpose or should he let the woman educate her daughter as she sees fit, even though she might espouse to idea which uphold patriarchal presuppositions ?",2021-01-29T05:05:48.000Z,5

And I've learned that focusing on yourself and what you want out of life attracts more women. I've put that into practice but I've only had a woman approach me once over the course of 5 years, 4 of those years in college. I refrained from approaching women, but I noticed that none ever really approached me. I have a good job as a software developer that I love, I've developed the body I've always wanted, and my art has improved so much. But no woman (excluding the 1 in college) has approached me.

Feminism,MA_Maine_research,[Study/Academic] MAINE residents: Paid research interview,"**Have you used the abortion pill?** 

Researchers at the University of Ottawa would like to conduct **90-minute telephone interviews** with anyone who has used mifepristone (also known as the abortion pill, medication abortion, or medical abortion) to end a pregnancy. 

You are eligible if you:  

¬∑ Used mifepristone to have an abortion on or after January 1, 2015  

¬∑ Were living in **Maine** at the time 

¬∑ Are sufficiently fluent in English or French to answer interview questions 

¬∑ Have access to a telephone, Skype, or Zoom 

During the interview, we will ask you series of questions about your background, your reproductive health history, and the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy. We will also ask you to tell us about your experience obtaining an abortion with pills and we will ask you to tell us about ways in which you think that services could be improved. 

All participants will receive a **$40 gift certificate** to www.amazon.com. Participation is both voluntary and confidential. Spots for this study are filled on a first come, first served basis. 

Please note that the abortion pill is not the same thing as emergency contraception, also known as Plan B or \"the morning after pill.\" 

If you would like more information about the study or research team, or if you are interested in participating, please contact us at [ws-stu02@uottawa.ca](mailto:ws-stu02@uottawa.ca). You may also contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Angel M. Foster, at [angel.foster@uottawa.ca](mailto:angel.foster@uottawa.ca).",2021-01-28T16:45:13.000Z,0

Few years forward he found me on Facebook. We are in our 40s now. I was a bit surprised to get a long message from this stranger and wanted to brush it off but he knew a lot about my past. He showed me a pic of him and I still had no idea who he is. Until he showed me his pic as a 17 year old.

For me it was,still is, just a random chat. But then he started with a bit too pushy for my liking messages. He named his cat after me, telling me I am his dream girl, sends me pics of his cat, complains a lot how girls are only after his money,.... I was super clear that I don't see him in the same way and never will. That he should focus more on positivity, maybe work on his body image (he gained a lot! of weight) and the right girl would come and that i am not that girl.

He still sends the same messages and I don''t reply.

&amp;#x200B;

From guys perspective. Is there something else I can tell him? Honestly, i don't want to be a mean bitch and tell him to f\\*\\*\\* off but I do want him to realise I will never ever see him as my partner(no matter how much money he brags he makes)

What exactly is the path to internalizing this idea as part of myself? Do I just keep risking taking L's (and possibly burning bridges with people) until I eventually don't care what the outcome of a situation is?

AskMen,jaymancds,"Those who have turned down big job offers, how did you handle it?","Hi, so a little back ground. Im 22, in Southern Missouri and I currently work in a finance job that I dont like at a company with little room for growth. Im also a part time college student with 2 years left. My career goal is to be in Executive level leadership in 10 years, and retired by 55. 

I bid on a supervisor role with another company that is a 1.5 hour trip one way from where I live. I didnt think anything would come of it. I interviewed over the phone and got a tour of their facility last week. I got the job offer a couple days ago, and I just turned it down. I currently make just shy of 40K, and this offer was for 51K plus a 3K sign on, and a 10% AIP. Obviously this would have been a huge jump in salary for me. 

The logistics of it all suck. The other company is literally an hour from everything, and I recently bought my first house which I dont want to sell yet. I did the math, and I would have been sleeping 4 hours a day to get everything done. I understand it takes a grind to get up the chain quickly, but I made a promise to myself years ago that I would never again live out of a monster energy can. 

The problem I'm having is that I feel like I'm throwing away a huge opportunity. I just feel like I'm letting myself down by turning down this spot even though I know the logistics make it basically impossible.

As a dark-skinned female, I‚Äôve crushed on guys of all colors of the rainbow, and it‚Äôs never been a deciding factor of attractiveness for me - normally facial features set the bar higher or lower. But I‚Äôm wondering if the same can be said for men since popular media focuses more on looks with females (and usually the ideal image is white skin). At the end of the day, if some guys are too close-minded to look past race or skin color, a big middle finger to them. But I ask in hopes that this is generally not the case.

Edit: I thought this was obvious, but when I say ‚Äútoo close-minded to look past race‚Äù I‚Äôm referring to people who are blatantly racist

They have been there since we met and I was more easily able to over look them but as I look to a future with her I know these will put a strain on our relationship and if they got worse I would simply lose my physical attraction to her.

I like her a lot and want to keep being with her but I think I need to have an honest and frank conversation about this with her. I know it's going to hurt her and our relationship though.

How have these conversations gone for those, who have been on either the receiving or giving end, in the past?

Is it worth having this conversation or is this a sign that maybe the relationship isn't meant to be in the first place?

P.s I know I'm a bit of an arsehole for feeling this way and wanting her to change.",2021-01-13T20:41:07.000Z,46

I want to improve myself but my discipline is not good, goal setting is not quite there and I get distracted by life (excuse, I know) and stop exercise, learning whatever I want to learn and take it back up again in a couple of months.

It‚Äôs a slow work in progress and I‚Äôm eager to learn discipline but not sure where to put my energy.

AskMen,flatbootybih,How do you feel when your girlfriend sleeps with an article of your clothing?,"My (24F) boyfriend (28M) left his beanie on accident the last time he came over and I realized it smells like him so I've been sleeping with it next to me on my pillow. He called at like 5:30 in the morning after he got off work and accidentally woke me up, after a few minutes of talking he goes \"is that my beanie?\" My half asleep brain didn't know what to say besides \"yeah it is, I missed you,\" and he seemed kind of bashful about it. I'm wondering though if it was a little bit creepy or how a girlfriend doing this makes men feel. Whether they're sleeping with your beanie or maybe a shirt or jacket you left, does it make you feel happy? Awkward? Creeped out? I'll wash it today before I give it back, just curious.

EDIT: I realized this would definitely be creepy if we haven't been seeing each other that long. To clarify, we've been together a year and a half.

EDIT 2: Sorry y'all are getting your clothes stolen so much, I promise I'm giving the beanie back and I never steal hoodies because I'm almost always wearing one already LOL",2021-01-09T22:45:31.000Z,41

Feminism,MagdaZither,The female role in classical music,"I am currently working on a project about women in music history and I already discovered so many composers, musicians and conductors. 

I studied music, have two bachelors degrees and still I haven't learned about one female historical figure in music. Have you learned in school/university about one? 

Classical music was and still is a quite misogynic place, but shouldn't we start in schools to change that?  

On the list of the world's best conductor is still no female, no female compositions in big opera houses and so on. 

How could we change this without starting at the beginning? And if so, how can we change that? In most curricula, they do not mention classical composers like Clara Schumann, Sophia Dussek etc. 

I remember being a little girl and my dad was a conductor and I told him: I want to be a conductor too, but that's only for men. 

That's what I was thinking, because of the lack of representation in school and media! 

What would your way to change that be?

Feminism,SPdoc,Discussion: not conforming to gender norms seems more stigmatized than conforming?,"The portrayal of a ‚Äòpick me‚Äô usually tends to be women shunning traditionally feminine things.  While negative stereotypes exist about women who love femininity, it seems less stigmatized in that it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or even favorable.  Same goes for men involved in traditionally masculine things.  

As a basic example, traditionally ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù or ‚Äúgothic‚Äù things are stigmatized moreso than women loving fashion and makeup or men (or even women, given the overall favoring of masculine things) loving sports. By stigma, I mean in the sense of being ‚Äúodd,‚Äù ‚Äúweird,‚Äù or just ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù from the norm.  Media itself perpetuates these kind of stigmas, and perhaps there is more to such stigmas in addition to not fitting gender norms? 

Men conforming to masculinity and women conforming to femininity seem to gain a certain power and social status, and in many settings can practice judgement against people of all genders who may be ‚Äúnerdy,‚Äù ‚Äúgothic,‚Äù etc.  I think the gamer girls who develop the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other girls‚Äù resentment also come from having faced ostracization from feminine girls and more acceptance among fellow ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù guys (not justifying by any means).  

This is a discussion in that I‚Äôm sharing based on my observations and would love to hear others‚Äô observations and experiences.  Maybe there are also differences in what‚Äôs more stigmatized by environments and age groups?

Disclaimer 1: I apologize for any cisnormative language.  I‚Äôd love to hear perspectives from trans/non-binary folk.  

Disclaimer 2: If it‚Äôs relavant, I‚Äôm a cis woman, and I practice femininity to a small extent (on occasion).",2021-01-08T01:05:07.000Z,1

My boyfriend (he was about 26 if that makes a difference, and from a more urban area) my Mom and myself went hiking up this trail to a giant rock plateau.  On the way up he says he has to pee.  So my Mom and I walk ahead to give him privacy.  

Coming back down we pass a few people and when we hit the pee spot I can see the dark wet puddle directly in the middle of the trail that people have to walk on/through.

In my life I've caught a few men I didn't know peeing in weird places they should be peeing in.  So I feel that it's a world that I don't fully understand.

But I couldn't wrap my head around why pee on the trail when it's lined with woodsy undergrowth on both sides.

AskMen,gangstabunniez,How do I deal with 'financial advisor' friend trying to sell me bad financial investments?,"Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of dilemma. I have recently gotten my first real job after graduating college, and am in a very good place financially. One of my very good friends has been working as a financial advisor for about a year now. After I started working, he asked if he could help me out by taking a look at my finances and offering some advice. I thought it was going to be some general, friendly advice, so I said yes. We met for lunch about a month and a half ago, and he came full suit and tie with a portfolio and everything. At that point I knew I was likely fucked, but had some hope. I gave him my financial information and he didn't really give any advice at that point, just complimented me on my success and said he could definitely work out investment plans, budget, etc for me. I agreed to a meeting in a week, and we went off.

At the next meeting, he gave me my financial plan. I was a little thrown off by some of the stuff he recommended - cash value life insurance (I'm 22 and have literally 0 dependents, and my work provides life insurance) , long term disability insurance (my disability insurance is pretty good already). I kept on anyways, and he threw a bunch of numbers and charts at me and said that I could likely buy a house in 5-10 years, which I was super stoked about. We agreed for another meeting, and went off again, except this time I was a little suspiscious.


I started doing some research on the company he works for (Northwestern Mutual) and some of the things he was recommending (like CV life insurance). At that point I started to realize I was being taken for a ride, and my friend was basically a life insurance salesman. The `used car salesman` of the financial world. Unfortunately I really didn't know what to do, and didn't know how to let him down. I met ONCE AGAIN, with him, and expressed disinterest in most things, but he kept trying to sell me hard to CV life insurance and a Roth IRA. I had been interested in setting up a Roth IRA, so I was hoping that I could just focus on that as maybe an out of all the other stuff that's definitely a scam. Unfortunately, NWM Roth IRAs suck, and I definitely wouldn't want to give them my money. I'm supposed to meet with him again, but have been saying that I need to run it by my father as an excuse. I have absolutely no idea what I am going to do, as I want to basically tell him I'm not interested whatsoever, but also don't want to be rude and lose him as a friend. Has anybody been in a similar experience that could help out?

TLDR: Friend is a life insurance salesmen. Met with him a couple of times thinking he was trying to give me helpful financial advice; he's actually trying to sell me. In too deep.",2021-01-29T01:32:00.000Z,24

AskMen,[deleted],"I am tired of living in a HCOL area, but it is the only area where my current career is available. I would like to move and change jobs, but worry about being short-sighted and would appreciate any advice.","My wife and I, with imminent children, live in the HCOL suburban sprawl of the Washington, DC metro. While our specific town has avoided all of the recent insanity, the nearly five years we have spent here is getting old. My wife wants to move, I would not mind a move, and I am sure future kids would appreciate getting out of a small condo.

Problem is, my career (niche work as an Army civilian) only exists around the DC corridor. I could hop between different offices or turn my commute into a two hour jaunt in exchange for a larger house, but we will still be geographically locked into the DC area. Complicating this is how my work itself is fine. Beyond a stressful assignment that will end within 18 months, I can see a 30 year career here.

Because of this, I am struggling making a choice. Now would be the best time to leave government work in terms of benefits and compensation, but I worry about moving just for the sake of moving. Is that an immature choice to make?",2021-01-12T16:25:49.000Z,11

My school has divided the students into 4 houses in which there are house captain from 10th grade and house vice-captain from 9th grade. I was my house vice-captain.

During the sports day, students from grades 9 to 12 have to do march past around the track with the captains and vice-captains leading their house. The group has 3 students in each row. The captains and vice-captains have to start from the middle of the group but on the side. Then we move to the front and then the group follows. We had to practice this for two days before the event.

The first day of practice, I was in the school non sports uniform - slim fit black pants, white full sleeve navy blue checked stitched shirt, navy blue tie and an id card tucked in the breast pocket of the shirt. Couple of girls from 12th grade called me and told me that I look good in that uniform and that I had a cute face. The next day they compared me with their heights. This made me high for the next week. 

Any time I saw them in the remaining time  they were in the school, I could not stop myself from smiling so much that I hurt my cheeks. I am never going to forget them.",2021-01-17T16:39:04.000Z,5

Feminism,DJJJKillem,Allyship Questions,"Hi Everyone,

25M here. My girlfriend (26F) and I are in the process of seperating amicably, and are discussing a disagreement we recently had, where she feels I failed to support and defend her. She was showing me an anime for the first time, and our two roommates, another couple, sat down to join us. The show, to me, seemed fairly lighthearted. It's called Inuyasha and it features a guy with dog ears and dog claws. It's pretty cool, it has some fun over the top action and monsters and stuff like that. During the show, my roommates were talking and commenting as they tend to do when we watch things, saying stuff like \"Serve\", and \"Slay\" whenever the dog guy's nails looked dope. I didn't really think anything of it, since they seemed to be enjoying it, but the next day, my girlfriend told me that she'd felt offended by their comments and was disappointed that I didn't defend her.

We still disagree about this. I don't really think that they were doing anything wrong by watching the show more like Spongebob than like Citizen Kane. They didn't actually say anything negative about the content of the show, and they seemed to be enjoying it, they were just making jokes. I told my girlfriend that I supported her if she wanted to say anything to them, but that I didn't feel comfortable saying anything to them myself, since I didn't quite understand what the upset was. She kept saying that she didn't want me to say anything to them, but also kept asking me to defend her, which left me at a loss. Eventually I did just talk to my roommates, since my girlfriend continued to say that they're being judgemental and rude. They said that they not only liked the show but had grown up watching it, and had nostalgic memories of it. I still told them that it had hurt my girlfriends feelings, to which they replied that they didn't quite understand why and that they wished she'd just said something to them.

I've been trying to tell my girlfriend that I support her standing up for herself, and that if anyone tried to say she was crossing a line by doing so, that I'd defend her. I've also been very clear that if anyone actually insults her, slanders her, or attacks her, I'd step in in a heartbeat, I just feel that it wasn't warranted. She told me that it's a feminist issue, and that as a woman, she feels uncomfortable telling a man directly that her feelings were hurt. She's telling me that I'm a bad ally for not intervening and either arbitrarily disagreeing with my roommate, or changing the subject. I want to be a good ally, but I'm at a loss. I kind of see me stepping in to solve social disagreements as disrespectful and patronizing. She's 26 and he's 23. We all went to college together and were peers. He loves her as a close friend. I agree that sometimes my roommate can be annoying, maybe even boorish, but I think me intervening based solely on that would be a gross overreaction. 

Is there something here I'm failing to understand? Do I just not know what it's like? Am I being unreasonable, toxic, or complacent?",2021-01-09T22:03:30.000Z,5

I don't mean being happy as someone who identifies as asexual, I'm talking about being someone that is generally sexually active but can go long periods of time without being so.

I'm currently in this situation and my wife isn't happy about it. She constantly tells me that she doesn't like that I'm happy without being sexually active and every time she brings it up, she asks me if I want to seek medical or mental help as if there is something wrong with me so, naturally, it's putting me off of having sexual interactions with her. I always tell her that there's nothing wrong with her and I'm just happy with the way things are but I also make a point to tell her that the things she says about it are quite hurtful.

She even goes so far as to try and coerce me into doing things I don't want to and it makes things even worse; I've also made sure she is aware of this.

How do I get her to understand that no matter what she does, if I don't want to be sexually active, I'm not going to be and that she absolutely needs to drop the subject? It's becoming a hindrance on our regular conversation because she usually finds a way to bring it up every two or three days.",2021-01-15T08:20:43.000Z,60

I want to get into men's fashion, and up my clothing style as well.

AskMen,Zionuchiha,"Everyone has preferences in a partner, but some things are requirements. What are your requirements for a partner?","(I'm talking about BESIDES stuff like being your preferred gender, being alive, etc. That joke isn't very original and it was barely funny the first time)

Anyway, I'm talking about other, somewhat more specific things.

For example, here's mine :

* NO SMOKING CIGARETTES
* No heavy drinking
* Must be ok with me being an agnostic
* Being overweight enough that it's really noticeable is a turn-off (I have nothing against a slight gut or some fat rolls here and here, but going much further than that is pushing it)
* Our senses of humor must match well
* Most importantly: She must actually WANT me. Feeling unwanted is something I struggle with already, so a relationship where I feel unwanted is just not happening.

Anyway, what about you guys? Please be as superficial and/or picky as you want.

Edit: I've trimmed down my requirements after realizing that a few of them are just strong preferences and that I'm a bit of a prick, but I think the requirements left are reasonable.

Edit 2: Holy shit, I had no clue that THAT many people had smoking as an instant dealbreaker. Does everybody just hate the smell or is it just not wanting to inherit the second-hand health problems?

AskMen,Pedro_Benning,How do I make it uncomfortable for my careless neighbour to live here?,"I am writing here, because I am looking for a solution that actually works.

So there is this neighbour under my flat. Every weekend, he parties.

He starts to party at 10pm, always has friends with him, who smoke a lot of weed and cigarettes.

So much that the noise and smell comes into my flat.

I told him to stop. That did not work.

I told him again.

I contacted the landlord.

It just goes on.

I reduced the rent.

No change.

Then I called the police more than once when they were too loud.

I heard them give them a fine.

Then they started to come up to my flat and ring at 2am to then disappear.

Every single weekend.

So the other guys landlord does not throw him out. My landlord does not do anything about the smoke.

As I had previous issues with my landlord, I even suspect him to have made this guy move under my flat on purpose.

I know what you will say: move out, run away.

That is the wrong reply as this kind of behaviour will repeat in other flats: if I do not do anything, they will continue. If I do anything but it's too weak, they will continue even more.

My best outcome is for him to hate the place and move out.

No more smoke, screaming and loud rap from him.

How do I accomplish that?

Only reply, if you can answer this question.",2021-01-10T19:32:15.000Z,27

I‚Äôll admit, I really only had the balls to go for girls I knew 100% that found me attractive.

I have more free time for sports and that's cool, but when I go to sleep in the evening it tends to nag me a lot. I am happy in my life, but there is a feeling of missing out.

9/10 times I hear how they left their exes because there was always something wrong with **them** or because **they** did something. We never hear their side of the story so we never give them the benefit of a doubt and automatically assume the poor girl was wronged. So now I take most things with a grain of salt and not \"simp\" over them until I can form my own opinion.

AskMen,wolflikehowl,"I may be leaving my current company, and feel myself disassociating without any guarantees yet. How do I stop this?","I've been 100% over my current job role for the past year now, and was almost out in April of last year until COVID hit and all hiring was put on hold. I didn't go to school for it, I just sort of happened into it because of who I knew and then through good work ethic and attitude, failed myself upwards into a position of responsibility I never asked/wanted to be in. However, now that the situation has normalized in my field, I'm back in trying to make that same move as before and thankfully, have been able to do three rounds of interviews with a company that I would be relocating for; the more I talked with them about the role, what I would be doing, and relocating, the more it feels like it is the move I should have made sooner, and desperately want to make happen.

But because of that, I can feel myself starting to detach from my current job and getting over attached to the idea of this new one, even though I still need to care about it as no offer has been sent yet. I have a couple big items in my court before I leave anyways, ones that require working more overtime than I'm currently already doing, but every time I think about starting them in the back of my mind that little voices chimes in saying \"you're going to be gone soon, why start now?\" even though I know I can't do that to them.

How can I keep myself grounded, and keep those feels of disconnection from getting worse, so I can continue doing my job to the level I need to? Or in case I don't receive an offer at all (which I'm hoping isn't the case)?",2021-01-31T16:54:03.000Z,3

AskMen,DulceShirini,What type of character traits would you like to see?,"Hello guys/dudes/bros/men/lads!

Sorry I didn't know which one to start with üòÇ

I'm a storywriter and the most difficult/frustrating thing I've found is writing and developing guy characters. I do the same procedure as I do when creating girl characters, just jumble up a bunch of character traits and get a new character smoothie, but I feel like there's more I could possibly do. One thing that I have noted is that many guy characters in animation act a certain way, and don't act a certain way; I don't remember seeing too many flamboyant guy characters growing up.

So here's a question to the men and boys of reddit, growing up, what were some attributes of guy characters you wished you could've seen growing up? Some women wish that there were more girl characters that could rely on themselves rather than a prince, is there anything like that for you guys?

(Sorry if I worded some things weird, I'm weird. üòÇ)",2021-01-28T21:59:28.000Z,26

I don't dread getting older, it's a part of life, however I can't seem to shake off thoughts in my head telling me that I should have accomplished more in my life by now. I should be entering into a new career field and working a higher paying job, I should be more financially secure, I should have a better apartment and have nice furniture like an adult, I should have traveled to many places by now, I should have started running long ago and have ran numerous marathons by now, I should have hobbies that bring me joy, I should have found my calling by now and be passionate about something, I should be more educated, I should be in a relationship. I realize most, if not all, of these are simply things I regret not having started on much earlier.

It seems like a systematic preference as there are very few variances/ or instances that would mimic the general male population and dating women who are heavier and/or thicker or actually just a normal body weight.

So I use underwear where the latex band is either covered by a fabric or that uses a non latex band. (a string?)

The problem is that all the underwear I have found is cotton. And I would like something more breathable for those very hot days. I think the best material for hot is polyester or silk? Does anyone have suggestions on brand with boxers briefs that fit my needs?

I don't wanna be too specific but the people are great it's just that I don't necessarily like them as much as I thought I would as I worked throughout that time period, but also because I have been doing horrible for past few weeks I do not know why they are keeping, like I've done so many things that shouldve made me lose the apprenticeship. So I'm just wondering do I go into work and ask to resign or I call.


Edit: idk if the ppl who commented will see this, but thank you very much for the replies, and that I will continue and complete my apprenticeship no matter what obstacles are in my way, I'm very shy with my workmates nearly everyday since we are a small group (I'd say 7 people work but roughly 3 or 5 people at work during weekdays) I just can't seem to start up conversations as I suck at thinking what we should talk bout, I just prefer to work but sometimes I would like to talk but can't think of a topic. Anyway I suck at these things but again thank you, thank you very much for these replies as I was very lost and scared on what I wanted to do before I posted on here, again thank you.",2021-01-22T20:13:03.000Z,4

Also, I've been with others who cum and their penis is so sensitive they need to stop, this guy keeps going and going and says it feels good.  I know the sensitivity can vary but looking for input on how common these things are.

For reference, I am a 49f, he is 46m.  I'm not sure if he's always been this way or if it's something that's changed with age.",2021-01-22T20:15:17.000Z,96

AskMen,anotherthrowaway2u,How to stop involuntary pelvic floor contactions?,"I was never aware of this concept until I started doing some research in hopes to find a solution for my premature ejaculation. I discovered clenching my anus was \"responsible\" for my PE and therefore I had to relax my pelvic floor muscle in order to not ejaculate but I noticed that I just couldn't... the slightest touch of my penis I would involuntary clench my PC muscle. So when masturbating I couldn't relax at all unless I stopped. Even throughout the day I'd notice that I was contracting and I had to consciously make the effort to relax. I also recently noticed this feeling of never fully emptying out my bladder and worse my bowels because there too I'd involuntary clench, interrupting the process in consequence not fully emptying everything out. So yesterday after pooping I wanted to confirm this so I decided to an enma when it came time to evacuate the water indeed the rest of the poop came out with it (pretty scary and disgusting knowing that all that was still in there without being aware). Has anyone experienced this or something similar and if so any solutions?",2021-01-01T19:31:30.000Z,21
Feminism,That-Raspberry-5768,Make up my own name?,"Hey everyone. So something that‚Äôs never sat right with me is taking a mans last name. Considering that to him, the idea of taking the woman he loves last name is unfathomable, so why should it be fathomable for me to take his? There‚Äôs a (sorta) simple solution here, and that is to just not take his last name and to keep the one that was given to me at birth, my fathers last name; however, that‚Äôs still a bit unsettling to me lol. 

My father has been emotionally abusive to me ever since I was little, and recently I‚Äôve decided to completely cut him out of my life. He is all things I never want to be‚Äîan abuser, manipulator, narcissist, racists, sexist, homophobic‚Äîeverything bigot. Plus, there‚Äôs not much notability in having my family name in general. The previous generations did not accomplish much and rather just passed on their trauma to the next which ultimately led to me and how I feel about my dad (in other words, they weren‚Äôt/aren‚Äôt great people). Basically, I don‚Äôt feel much honor keeping my dads family last name. 

I‚Äôm a first generation college student about to graduate next year and am going to medical school. The more I think about my dads last name being on my diploma and doctorate degree makes me more and more sick, honestly. I don‚Äôt have any desire bringing honor to a family that has dishonored me so incredibly. For a year, I‚Äôve been thinking about coming up with my own meaningful last name and changing it from my family last name. Has anyone ever done this? Or should I keep my dads last name because it is technically still my last name? The other issue is that since I have been thinking about it for a year, no name I‚Äôve come across has lit the light bulb. 

I could take my moms last name (she‚Äôs also against the idea and would rather me just take a new mans name, NOT an option don‚Äôt suggest it haha), but it‚Äôs STILL A MANS LAST NAME!! I want to make my OWN last name. Why can‚Äôt my children take my last name? Why can‚Äôt my own name be on my own academic achievements? Idk lol I need opinions. Also how do you suggest I approach finding a new last name?",2021-01-01T19:32:28.000Z,25

This combined with my normal need to usually poop 2 times a day, sometimes 3, stresses me out which has the wonderful effect of making my stomach feel more unstable, and I when I need to go, I struggle to hold it very long.

AskMen,donthavearealone,What exactly is considered overdressing?,"Hi guys I‚Äôve got a stupid question but here‚Äôs the back story. I‚Äôm 26 and have a job where I wear a suit and tie most days. Up until a couple months ago been in a relationship for 7 years and have a couple kids so really all I‚Äôve done is go to work and hang out at home with the family. So honestly I don‚Äôt even have a pair of jeans or shoes that aren‚Äôt leather dress shoes, I only have dress clothes and lounge around the house clothes. 

I‚Äôve started dating a wonderful woman who is the kitchen manager at an Applebee‚Äôs in a more rural area and I‚Äôm going there on Saturday to have dinner with her and meet her friends/coworkers. My girlfriend dresses muchhhhhhh more casual than I do which is totally fine, honestly I just really love looking sharp myself. That being said I don‚Äôt want to come off as some uppity city douche when I meet the people she cares about. They already know I live in a penthouse and tease her enough as it is about me being a city guy lol.

So what do you recommend I wear? I want to be more casual for the situation but I also don‚Äôt want to look in the mirror and feel like I‚Äôm being someone I‚Äôm not.

Edit: I went to the store and decided to go with a pair of designer jeans (before I get roasted, they‚Äôre super comfortable and have a bit of a sheen to them so they‚Äôll pair nice with a jacket). I got a soft undershirt, and a cardigan, and scarf (it‚Äôs gonna be cold). I‚Äôll wear that with my black leather shoes and a nice watch!",2021-01-21T18:27:44.000Z,33

AskMen,peanut_pioneer,Any advice for keeping it together for my family during a debilitating multiple bereavement?,"Hey there, I hope none of this comes across as attention seeking, I‚Äôm just at a loss right now and need some words, kind or otherwise. 

My Grandmother died just after Christmas. We were extremely close. Since the loss of my grandmother, I have received news that my mother has at best a couple of months to live due to the rapid progression of two brain tumours (out of nowhere). My grandmother‚Äôs passing, whilst at least rationalisable, was debilitating. My mother‚Äôs news was not expected. Or rationalisable, it‚Äôs debilitation of me does not bear words. I am 25 years old and I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do. I need to rally my family around my father (there are also not words for his merit as a good man) and support myself and my partner, alongside my brother and his partner. 

My mind is in tatters. I am two days deep in whiskey. I am not religious and I am a physicist, so I know the universe is a cold and indifferent place. This property takes on a whole new quality when it hits you personally. 

Anyway I have bleated enough. Anyone who takes the time to read this I can only thank you. Any words, be they kind or otherwise, are appreciated. 

If you have the sort of relationship with your mother where this is appropriate, hug her. Please.",2021-01-18T02:23:00.000Z,24

Feminism,jbrunj,Sexism in my workplace,"I (29F) work in manual labor. I am the only woman on my team. I constantly deal with sexism at work but one co worker is the worst. I‚Äôve been at my wits end and close to quitting from the exhaustion of dealing with the almost constant sexism and micro-aggressions. So I finally reported him to my supervisor for a series of sexist comments and actions over the last few months. My supervisor was very supportive and reported the issue to HR and now my sexist male coworker will have to meet with the head of HR on Monday. 

For some reason instead of feeling relieved I am feeling immense guilt for possibly getting this person in trouble, I don‚Äôt want to risk anyone‚Äôs employment during such a shitty job economy and global pandemic. But I also can‚Äôt continue being made to feel like such garbage at work for my gender. While I still believe he is 100% in the wrong and I know I can‚Äôt continue to work their unless something changes, I am slightly regretting filing the complaint. I don‚Äôt believe he will be fired for the offenses, but I‚Äôm worried he will see it that I was trying to get him fired or something. It will definitely make him angry. 

I also am fearing possible back lash from him and the other men on the team. I am so worried that I‚Äôve now just made my already mentally exhausting job into a living nightmare. 

I‚Äôm probably turning a rope into a snake, but I guess I am looking for advice as to how to prepare myself to handle the likely inevitable backlash. As well as handling this unnecessary guilt for doing what I needed to do.",2021-01-23T19:30:24.000Z,9

AskMen,TechnalCross,I have too many interests! How do I remain motivated on each of them without burnout?,"I'm a film student.

When I say that, I'm interested in ALL FACETS of the industry. From casting to voice over to gaffers to directing to intern-bring-me-the-coffee shit. And every day I try to at least learn something or do something about each part that I'm interested in.

However; I also have some hobbies I'm super into as well. Video games, voice acting, getting into shape, being young and going out, etc. And it's getting to a point where all my interests are burning me out emotionally and mentally. I want to do well in my industry but I also know that being an all-rounder ends up being exhausting when you're working hard to be a A+ in everything at minimum. I find myself taking a lot more mental health breaks and putting my interests aside for my casual job that I despise. And I'm constantly reaffirming myself that I'm only 21 and shouldn't be expected to be majorly established so young, despite what social media and shit like YouTube or Twitch.tv show.

So, gents; what do *you* do when you've got so many different interests all at once and want to stay engaged in all of them? How do you manage without burning yourself out? Do you schedule in rest days? Do you take leaps of faith and dive head-first? I'd truly love to know!",2021-01-29T03:11:13.000Z,2

The last few weeks, she has been dealing with some pretty bad anxiety/OCD tendencies regarding her sexual identity. It‚Äôs bizarre, but I feel like it stems from her strict Catholic upbringing and watching porn. 

Nevertheless, there are consistent, ridiculous what-if scenarios that she‚Äôs been texting me about, and all I can do is reaffirm to her how ridiculous they are and remind her of reality and how she truly feels about everything. 

She dealt with something similar in college and will be seeing a therapist next week, but what are some suggestions you can offer to help me steady the boat when it‚Äôs just us? Disclaimer: 90% of these conversations occur through text. When we‚Äôre together, this isn‚Äôt really brought up ever, because we‚Äôre often doing something/preoccupied.

Feminism,ksjwo,Why are men so angry about women being interested/believing in astrology,"I don't know if this is the right sub, since I'm not sure if this is inherently connected to feminism, but I'm curious to hear your opinion.

Lately I noticed how men react so loudly when a woman brings up, even in a superficial way during a non serious discussion, astrology or signs. They usually firmly deny everything the counterpart is saying and go as far as to insult their intelligence or ability to think critically.
I am not saying astrology is scientifically based and whether you believe in it or not is not the point of this post.
What I am trying to say here is that I think men tend to react to it in a very agressive and disproportional way, almost as if they are personally attacked.

I never understood why and I would like to hear your opinions/experiences on this.
I am aware that believing in astrology might make someone angry, since it's not science-based, but I think that there are bigger threats to science (like no vaxxers, flat earthers and so on) than thinking that your date of birth has an impact on your personality. Again: I'm not saying it's correct, I'm just saying that it's pretty harmless and there's no reason to react so heatedly about it. And I notice this behaviour especially towards women, even when they make only a superficial comment.",2021-01-12T15:20:29.000Z,85
