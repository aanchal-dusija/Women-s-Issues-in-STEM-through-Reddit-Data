AskMen,Cleopatra_91,How Do I Not Feel Alone?,"This is my first post on this page, so plz let me know if I'm breaking any rules. I'm a 19M introvert, but I communicate well and have worked with a lot of other people in various departments, so I guess you can say that I can be an extrovert when required. Over the past two years, I've been feeling lonely no matter how many people I surround myself with. At work, I talk and have fun with co-workers, but as soon as I get into my car and drive back home, I feel like I'm alone and I got no one else to talk with. For school, I try to make new friends, but I always get rejected or ghosted. Honestly, if I get rejected one more time, I can't take it. I'm a great guy, I know that b/c my co-workers always say I got a great personality, but even with that, I just don't have friends. I've never had a gf or been in a relationship either. It's frustrating sometimes since there's times where I want/need to talk to someone, but I got no one. Overall, I'm a pretty happy guy when talking/working with others, but as soon as I get time to myself, I feel like I'm the only one who understands myself, and that no one would understand how much I'm being suffocated by loneliness. 

I run every morning to clear my head, and it helps for a short time. I listen to music 24/7 as it's the only source that makes me feel a bit better. Sometimes, I want to hike and camp in the mountains by myself for a day just to get my bearings back together, and wonder what direction my life is heading. I have hobbies, but they're only a band aid to my problem. This deep dark feeling inside me has already started prior to the pandemic, and its only gotten worse ever since.

Anyone have any advice on how to not feel alone?",2021-01-15T23:27:32.000Z,6

I can’t even workout without being stared down by 30 men. It makes me hate going to the gym because when I do all the looks I get makes it hard to focus on what I’m doing at the time. 
And all people have to say is “men will be men”....  
If that’s what a man is I don’t want it have some fucking respect how hard is it. I can understand a glance on a person here or there even I do that
But doing it to every women that walks by...
And We just have to ignore it. I fucking hate this world. It’s like I can’t walk out of my house without constantly being reminded that I’m a women. That’s not a bad thing but it’s gotten to a point where anytime I go or do anything all my mind goes to is the people starring at me. 
Fucking men will be men.... 
They’re reasons men act this way yes, and most definitely not directly because they have a dick
Stop making ducking excuses for them 
Men wonder why women care so much about their looks it’s because it’s all men and society likes to remind them of


EDIT:
Look I understand that not all men or like this but when they are they are majority of the time never held accountable.
Im basically a kid still...  (Im 16, had to happen to me since I first turned 12)
I had this happen to me far before I would ever be about to deal with it
The reason this triggers me so much is simply because of how hard it has effected me in the past. It's has effect my sexuality desire, my relationships, my self esteem and my personality. What is it going to take to make people realize that this behavior is just not okay. This is someones child... How do you expect a 12 or 16 yo to process that? Theres 1 to 2 option and both will drastically effect them in the future. This is a type of trauma and no kid should ever be made to \"just deal with it\" or \"take it as a compliment\"",2021-01-14T01:21:19.000Z,12

Their hobbies are playing pc and mobile games. Most of those games are MOBA. My laptop is a 32-bit dinosaur that can only handle pixel games. My phone, on the other hand, would have to abandon a lot of necessary apps to play the MOBA they're playing.

I'd like to generate something iconic which could be placed in the public domain (CC0 license) for others to use and elaborate upon further.

The lightbulb symbolizes inspiration, and is integrated with the traditional feminine symbol; the triangles express radiating ideas which illuminate; the exclamation mark suggests insight, conclusions and strength of expression. What do you think? How could this be improved? (I considered making the triangles double headed arrows to include the concept of intersectional social justice issues, for example).

AskMen,Dng_1993,What's the big attraction with moving away from your hometown?,"Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE to travel, I can't get enough of it. But my home is my home, it has it's good points and it has its bad points. It has a lot of bad points. But so does everywhere, you just don't know them 'till you're there. That's not to say that I wouldn't want to travel for months at a time. And one day, I'd also love to own a second home in Italy, and spend the winters there, because I detest the cold English winters.

Now, I am lucky enough to live within an hour's train ride of London, Birmingham, Nottingham, the coast, and several national parks can so I guess in some ways it's different for me, because I can do business with many places quite easily, and can easily switch between countryside and cityscapes whenever I want.

I completely get having to move for work, if theres no work where you are, or the work is poor paying. I would do the same, though it would be reluctant. I also get moving away to start anew if you have had a terrible time in your hometown, hate your family and have no friends.

But I LOVE my family and friends, I love being around them. If I didn't have them, I would probably want to move abroad, but I'm genuinely happy to stay here and want to stay here because of my family and friends.

Obviously many of them (especially friends) don't share that same sentiment though. Well, they miss people, but not enough not to happily move to set up shop elsewhere.

I have a couple of friends and family members that have moved away that I now see once a year at best.. I'm 28, so the thought of only seeing them perhaps another 50 times in my lifetime if that, is pretty heartbreaking.

I also don't like the idea of continuously meeting new people, making new friends, only to one day leave them all behind and barely ever see them again, only to start all over again and repeat the cycle. I LOVE the idea of making new friends, just not at the cost of old, established, good ones.

I also have spent many years, having multiple good friends within a 10 minute drive. There's always been somebody to support me if I'm going through a hard time, theres always been somebody I know well to share a meal with, or do something fun with. I have always appreciated that. Being somewhere where there may not be anybody around me that I consider deeply well known or a best friend, to have around me as a social network, sounds horrible.

Am I just over sentimental or something? To be honest, I find it quite depressing. Because to me it makes me feel a sense of pervasive loneliness to be so isolated from everybody or to be around people but nobody that feels permanent..",2021-01-04T09:05:53.000Z,20

\"Women rape and abuse people as well!!\" \"not all men are bad people!\" 

I always say something about that. I give statistics, arguments, examples to disprove that kind of ideas, but generally the conversation tends to end like \"we're all entitled to our own opinion.\" Or \"let's agree to disagree.\" 

After that kind of conversation, I feel like I'm burning inside. I'm so angry and I feel like I cannot do anything else. 

How do you cope with that?

Edit: When I say \"not all men are bad people\" or \"women rape and abuse people as well\", I know that it happens. I qualify it here as nonsense because it is used as a way to negate the issues women face.

However after getting through basic I’ve lost the motivation to lift and even run when I use to love it. I feel like I lost it and I don’t have the same diet, I don’t even like to go outside as much and yet I have so much camping gear, climbing gear, and I loved to travel. Now I can’t really use the gear as much as I use to camping every weekend. I can’t climb somewhere and I can’t even really go out to the gym even on base with my work hours and the hours the gym is open.

AskMen,[deleted],Why do I care what my Dad thinks?,"So start of all the lockdowns my wife could work from home, and I worked with the public, so since the daycares closed it only made sense that I should stay home with my daughter. After months of craziness the question came up of when I should return to work. I worked a minimum wage job, most of my pay went to daycare, wife got a huge raise at work, tl:dr we decided I would be a stay at home dad, at least during the pandemic, possibly until our daughter is in school. We start telling everyone we know, friends and family (not in a coming-out kind of way, just telling them what's going on with us), and everyone is supportive. Most guys in my life think it's cool, some are kind of jealous. No one gives me a hard time about it. Then my Dad found out...

As soon as he finds out he calls me as if to have an intervention. He's mostly concerned about my career (which I don't have, and he doesn't know that because he never talks to me), accuses me of trying to retire before I turn 40, tries to start brainstorming a new career for me, thinks that a gap on my resume will be the end of my working life.

I'm blindsided by the whole conversation but I don't budge an inch. I more/less said that we looked at our finances and it was difficult but doable, and in exchange I'd get non-stop time with my young daughter (currently 2), as well even more family and wife time with her just working upstairs, and keeping my family safe was worth a few lines on my resume.

Once I was off the phone I conferred with she unsurprisingly agreed with me. 

I don't care about my Dads opinion of me. He broke up our family partly because he worked too much, then spent decades after the divorce in a pissing contest with my Mom because he had lots of free time and disposable income. He was an enormous asshole my entire life, mellowed out some in old age but only because he just argued less. Family get togethers are peaceful enough, essentially because of a non-aggression pact because theirs grandkids now.

I've not been unconcerned myself about this decision. My wife was the one that suggested it (based on conversations we'd had in the past) and I basically ask her once a week if she's REALLY sure about this and if she's ok with all that financial pressure and can we really afford it even for a short time (haven't totally pulled the trigger yet)? She's always assured me we'll be fine and we can make it work. And I am giving up a full time job, a shitty minimum wage job but I worked really hard for a long time just to get it. I won't miss the job but I do understand the value of giving it up.

So it's all settled, I don't care what my Dad thinks, my wife and I are sure this is what we want to do, and everyone else we know is cool/indifferent about it. Why am I still fuming about this conversation days later? I've tried over and over again to put these feelings down and I can't seem to.",2021-01-28T05:10:49.000Z,7

I've brought it up with him more than once, and he's said that he can be quite sweaty at times because he has to walk up a hill to get to our house. But it's not that.

I suppose the title for my post is a bit disingenuous, because he is quite a grub; he doesn't know how to clean properly, has never opened his bedroom window and, I'm sorry to use stereotypes here, but he's a 21 year old goth-bogan kid. I dunno, just looks dirty.

Can having a dirty room really make you smell so bad all of the time, even if you shower reasonably often?

I work from home as a technical writer, am 30, single, exercise, no drugs, have a mechanical engineering degree. But I feel I have become a p-u-s-s-y. Too scared of facing the world without my dad.

I did think about studying more and applying to big tech companies in Silicon Valley but I was, again, too p-u-s-s-y to leave home away from my dad.

How do I reverse this?

Edit: Outside college, I have never talked to any girl ever.",2021-01-30T14:58:14.000Z,18

I was watching all these New Age videos on YouTube and often they talk about how to apply the Law of Attraction to relationships. For instance how to manifest a text from a person you like or signs that a girl and the guy are soulmates or whatever. 

There's one thing I noticed about all these channels and that is that over 90% of the comments are women. This made me curious, so I thought let me ask men directly. What is your honest view about this spiritual stuff? Do you believe in it? Do you believe in some of it? Thanks :).",2021-01-30T15:12:31.000Z,34

So at work we usually order breakfast. I do the ordering. Put it on my card with the understand that everyone will pay their share. It just makes it easier to do one card. Here recently.  Actually not recently. Quiet often. I’m not being paid back. And I either have to chase people down to get it or I forgot who owes me and I’m just out the money. I’m over it. I’ve brought it up to them before. And nothings really improving. So at this point I am probably going to say I won’t use my card any more. Which I hate to do.

AskMen,crazyashley1,What is the morbid fascination with nutshots?,"Hey Men of Reddit.  

I have never understood the weird game some dudes play where they intentionally find ways to strike themselves painfully in the balls.  Y'all always say its so painful, but then go and do it for fun with your friends.  I've been kicked in the crotch with full strength, intentional karate kicks, and it *sucks!* I can't imagine doing so willingly.  I've asked my husband but he doesn't get it either.

Is this just a highly filmed \"Jackass\" type thing from the idiots only club?  Is it a dare?  

I should note that I'm not referring to cock and ball torture fetishes or whatever those xiaolin monks were doing with kicks and bricks a while back.  Just dudes dropping truck tires on their friend's boys or purposely taking a seesaw or a swingpole to the crotch.

AskMen,MiloJ44,What do you wear around the house on a lazy day/evening?,"Hi all. I thought this one might be quite pertinent given that a lot of us are in lockdown at the moment.

For years I always used to wear jeans around the house all the time. People always used to be surprised when I said this. But I always felt they were comfortable enough and I liked the fact I didn't need to get changed if i popped out the house for whatever reason to head to the shops or whatever.

Last month I managed to break my leg (long story). Having a cast on my leg meant that jeans suddenly weren't so appealing. For Christmas my older sister bought me a pair of sweatpants/jogging bottoms/whatever you want to call them. To be honest they are a revelation. They are super comfortable for lounging around the house during the day. I feel like I've suddenly seen the light.

So, what do you guys wear when you're relaxing at home?",2021-01-30T18:00:49.000Z,32

I am currently reading \"Good Economics For Hard Times\" and I regularly read \"Very Short Introductions\" by Oxford Press to get a good introduction into a field of study.

Feminism,JudgementDragon12345,"To bring up a lower-scale issue, what are some women's thoughts on subtle assumptions implied by video games and other media, I.E. gender locked classes or a disproportionate level of female support roles vs female front line characters?","This is likely by no means THE be all end all of feminist issues, real life before fiction (though fiction can be socially important) and all that, but I wanted to perhaps talk about something on the low-brow end of the scale for a moment.

As a man myself, I notice that many subtle things tend to promote social norms even in more modern media. Examples include, but are not limited to...

Elements, men get more of the aggressive or \"mighty\" elements like fire, earth, darkness, lightning, etc. Meanwhile women tend to trend towards light, water, wind, etc in media.

Combat positions, men are INSANELY trending towards front line warrior roles, and even hold some of the higher \"softer\" roles like holy folk or mages at times, while women tend to usually be the healers, mages, and rogues by default.

Support roles vs protagonist roles, not to be confused with battlefield roles like fighter or cleric, I mean level of agency and role in the story. Even if that woman is IN a major role, they seem to not only suffer the prior trappings, but they also tend to somehow fare worse than the men and get sidelined. Examples include plenty of shounen anime, where even though Sakura is one of the original main three in Naruto, she is shafted in many ways compared to Sasuke, and this one is so famously well known even by casual anime fans as well.

So on, so on, so forth, I feel like these issues still linger in some places even today, though I hear and see it getting slowly but surely better.

Also, as one last bonus point, I'm aware that shounen is targeted to young boys/teenage boys, but when I've seen plenty of \"for girls\" media write even ONE decent male character, then I think boy-targeted media can do it just fine as well for women. I think marketing is no excuse for lack of effort after all.

So what do you think? Am I missing anything here? You would know best I think, and I'm willing to learn.",2021-01-05T13:43:32.000Z,3

AskMen,Ian_Dima,How do you eat dinner with your family?,"All my life we would sit at our living room table and eat together. But then this pandemic happened and things changed. For the better.

My father is a non-violent choleric with an affective disorder. Dinner was a gamble. Mention the wrong topic he would start ranting and if you dared to disagree he would make you at fault for ruining the mood. If he talked with his mother on weekends before dinner, I had to prepare to have stomach aches after because all the stress didnt allow my organs to properly digest the food.

Now, the pandemic happened and I have the privelige to study from home with my parents again. For lunch I established with my mother, that she would cook (I clean up afterwards), while my father was at work and we would sit on the couch watching some nature-documentary.

I tell you, that shit is so relaxing. Youre munching on your favorite spaghetti while half-listening to David Attenborough is explaining why some fabulous birds are dancing to get laid.

Somehow my mother convinced my father that we should do that for dinner. And it changed everything. No stupid smalltalk, no opinionated rants, just calmness. Sure my father has still to comment on some shit because he knows it better but if just you leave it as such, he quits it very fast.

So how are you all doing? Traditional dinner at the table or are you making a campfire and play Wonderwall? Red weddings?",2021-01-30T15:44:20.000Z,14

But we hear stuff like this all the time. People taking advantage of people for financial gain.

What if money is a game? And not everybody is meant to have money? So the man complaining that hedge funds, corporations and the mega rich have an unfair amount of resources (money) that should be redistributed down to them via taxes is actually not mechanically correct? The guy plainly has lost the game to whatever degree he has money, or doesn’t have money. 

Makes sense to me. If life is based upon hierarchy, then really, nothing has gone wrong fundamentally. Sure you could say it’s unfair or whatever and we’re human and we’re above that because we have large brains and god in our side. But... it would be. But it’s supposed to be in that sense, because not everybody is meant to win.

Anyway. Idk if this is the place to post this.

AskMen,SubstantialSir773,What makes men infatuated with fat guys?,"So basically I (M 21 5’11) got up to 320 lbs in high school, still pretty fat at about 230 right now. It always seemed like any of the guy friends I had were always infatuated with squeezing my boobs and jiggling my fat. There were multiple occasions where they would reach under my shirt and cup my man boobs, or aggressively jiggle my fat. I couldn’t really stop them as they were all much stronger than I was. This started in middle school I would say. Is there a reason for this other than just general harassment? It really didn’t bother me much at the time, other than a little embarrassment since these completely ripped guys were grabbing handfuls of my doughy body— but now it just seems curious. At age 21 it isn’t nearly as much of a problem, although occasionally another guy will still pat my belly or “slam dunk” my tits. I’ve heard many similar testimonies from former fat guys in high school— so can any former “jocks” shed some light?",2021-01-09T11:09:23.000Z,30

AskWomen,reagan92,2 Million Subscribers,"Hello! This week we did something I don't think any of us ever planned or expected - AskWomen has reached 2 million subscribers. 

To celebrate, we wanted to do something different and (hopefully) lighthearted and create an opportunity for us to get to know each other in a direct and personal manner. A chance to see the human behind the screen, so to speak. Obviously we're not going to dox ourselves, but we'd love to discuss with the community a little bit about our experiences as mods, how we have navigated the past 10 years, and ideally, share and discuss some of the truly weird and wild stuff we have seen (and filtered) since 2010.

The format of this topic will be for you to ask questions to mods as a group. Meta questions about specific rules/guidelines/policies, or individual experiences should still be directed to [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskWomen) and as always, questions must fit within the [rules of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/rules). 

Questions about mods life outside of reddit will be answered at individual mod discretion, so while we likely won't answer questions like \"where do you live/where do you work\" very directly, you may find more detail with questions less identifiable like \"how/why did you become an askwomen mod\" or \"How do you find being a mod here affects your life outside of reddit\". That said, we're really looking forward to this, as it's not something we have ever done before and we are excited to interact with our fellow community members more personally.

Thank you everyone for contributing to 2 million members over the last decade, and thank you to everyone who participates in this thread and community in good faith. You're the reason we do this.",2021-01-09T11:30:47.000Z,355

I kind of thought she was just doing the sexting to make me happy.  Egotistical, I know.  So one night we are texting, and I was trying to keep it clean.

AskMen,darakristi,How do I decline hanging out with a guy I barely know without being insulting?,"Hi 🙋🏻‍♀️ 

I am 25 F and I work at a leading global technology company on a massive campus. The overwhelming majority of employees there men, I would estimate 2 out of 10 being women. I assume that this is the reason I receive some advances out of the blue. 

I work nights and clock out of work every morning around 7:00 AM. This guy in question (let’s call him “G”) works the opposite shift and comes in to work as I leave. He approached me one day and introduced himself, saying that he has noticed me at work and thought he’d say hi. He is a very confident, social person with a nice personality. 

After he learned my name, I returned to my next shift and found an IM from him on our campus-wide chat. He began initiating conversations with me about random BS, honestly, like my favorite food, my goals, my favorite music, etc. The conversation was so shallow but his enthusiasm and lengthy messages were hard for me to ignore and I would humor him by asking more questions.

Eventually, he asked me to go get some tacos with him outside of work. I am in a committed relationship but my boyfriend is very secure and wouldn’t mind me hanging out with another guy if it was platonic. So I responded with something like “I would love to but, not to be presumptuous, I am in a relationship. Let me know what you think.” He responded as long as it isn’t an issue for me that he wouldn’t mind. My boyfriend and I had assumed he was just humoring me so as not to be obvious that he was hoping to make it a date and then turn me down when he found out I was taken. I told him I would take him up on that offer after the new year even though I had no intentions of hang out with him. 

He is very nice but he doesn’t know anything substantial about me and we aren’t even on the same shift or in the same department. Our company is so massive that we don’t even have work experiences in common. The intent to hang out just feels unnatural to me and I can’t help but question his eagerness. I have to reiterate that he is very respect and polite, not creepy or pushy. 

Weeks later, he still texts me and asks how I’m doing. His last text said “By the way, let me know what day and time works for you and let’s go grab a bite soon, yea?!”.... 

All in all, I am very confused by why he wants to hang out with me if A) can’t date me or hook up with me and B) doesn’t know me enough to think we’d be compatible as friends. I feel that typically you at least have some shared interests and commonalities that would lead you to hanging out with someone and further getting to know someone but this is so inorganic and random that I am skeptical. It would be a lot easier to decline if he were being creepy or flirtatious. 

What do you think about all this?",2021-01-17T13:46:03.000Z,27

AskMen,ttthrowitawayfaraway,"When it comes to relationships with a girl, what do men daydream or fantasise about in particular?","Outside the salacious obviously. 

I was thinking about our own fantasies as women, and noted how our ones (or mine lol) usually revolves around being with a strong man doing some heroic act, something impressively masculine, but then on the flip side also being mundane, loving, protective, fun, cheesy, intelligent etc, you get the image. I think many women agree that they share this image too. 

But I have zero clue about what men fantasise about. Usually I wouldn’t pry but ruminating about how realistically I’d see my fantasies manifest in reality, in my relationship one day, I wondered what men fantasise about and what want to see manifest in their relationship one day. 

I assume that y’all daydream about devotion, tender love, bonding over interests, but is there something larger than that that comes to mine? Are we women really the ones with the detailed imaginative idealism?",2021-01-17T13:52:43.000Z,135

What are some clues that help me find out if he sees me apart of his future plans (which ever plan that is)? 

When people are in school, thats the similarity, but once graduation hits, its \"figure it out\" so its only fair to ask if he wants to have that kind of relationship commitment given his new freedoms of living on his own. I want him to be happy (even if that means letting me go), but don't want to bring any more anxiety than he already has (even though he would probably deny saying he at all anxious).

Let's say K 
So around 8-9 of us boys are just sitting and chatting, he is sitting in front of me and he blows his hand right there.
Nothing bad happened coz, lucky me, I got that on my penis instead of balls but it surely Leds to an Oooouuuchh reflex.

My other bois gave him a glare, he stayed quite afterwards.

Few days passed, sitting with my girlfriend, he gives blow out of nowhere... again...why??? 

So this time, I was angry, coz it actually hit me in BALLS!!!

I chased him down and surely returned the favour and gave him taste of his own medicine.

AskMen,dude_wheresmykarma,Have you guys struggled in your relationship with financial disparities between you and your partner? How'd it work out?,"Context:

I have been dating my gf for a little over a year and have been paying for everything for her including food, rent, utilities, and even tuition/books since she's going back to school. I really don't mind this too much, I just told her I'd like to be able to save a bit of money per month (I used to save as much as possible before her and am a bit stingy). She also works full time making $15/hr which is not an awful lot where we live. For the last several months though I've been having growing anxiety regarding bills and CC payments and have talked to her about cutting back on some things as I looked at the monthly statements and realized she's spending quite a bit, more than I am on myself personally. For instance, last month one of our CC bills was around $4000 and I went and itemized everything to figure out about $2500 was due to her personal spending, with the remaining $1500 on me but really both of us as I count grocery trips, meals, anything that involved both of us on that $1500 which was really the majority. Like I said, I don't mind paying for her necessities but some of that was things like massages and other Amazon purchases I don't think are really necessary unless she wanted to pay for them. She has insisted she'll cut back so we'll see on that.

The other issue is (and maybe I'm being selfish here), I feel like since I'm paying for everything, I kind of hoped she would help me out more around the house. I understand she works a full time job and I do as well, and she's also going to school but if I were in that position I would feel obligated to help a bit more and try to make it more equitable in some way. She has not been willing to do that up until now, even though I've talked with her about me feeling taken advantage of a bit. When I say help, I just would rather not cook 3-4 days a week and do the dishes all the time like I do now. To her credit she does laundry and some cleaning, but it still feels very unbalanced and I think that's because I'm factoring in doing this AND paying for literally everything. I just know if the roles were reversed I'd be bending over backwards to help around the house and cook and clean and whatever would help her out because I'd be so appreciative of her paying for everything. This is not what she thinks because she says she also works full time and goes to school which I definitely understand. I'm getting a little frustrated with what I feel like is an unbalanced relationship, and it's causing a rift between her and I.

tl;dr: I pay for everything for my gf, I'm not able to save as much bc of this, and I feel like she should help out a bit more around the house to make the relationship more equitable.

So anyways, I'm curious, have any other guys (or girls) faced this kind of disparity? Any suggestions from those who have worked things out?",2021-01-05T21:55:11.000Z,9

Even if it was nothing much as a simple 2-second hug.

I was star-struck. because I thought it was okay to do so. For me, I was brought up to kiss and hug my female friends. My mother is the one who taught me to do so.  I questioned her why one day. And she said that that small bit of physical affection makes the friendship that much better. That it's to show to the exact people you show that affection to, understand that you mean something to them.

Does it make me weird? Is what I'm doing unusual. I see no wrong. If the friends I do it to don't mind, they themselves seem to be chill about it?",2021-01-01T09:29:25.000Z,53

Feminism,Melquiades2503,Female Purity vs Objectification,"Hey y’all! 

I’m a guy who frequents this sub a lot (redpill, askmen sometimes, and reddit misogyny is kinda bad for my mental health so this is kind of my only refuge on this app lmao) and I wanted to ask you guys what you think of this: 

Lately I’ve been reading into some Dworkin and MacKinnon when it comes to porn, prostitution, etc. I like the whole decriminalization but not legalization. Seems really worth it. I would also like to see a huge rehabilitation bill by Congress some time in the future specifically for women (and some men) who have been irrevocably damaged by the sex trade. 

That being said, I wanted to ask you guys if you think we live in a culture that either (A) demands female purity (B) oversexualizes women or (C) demands female submissiveness over all else...whether that be sexually or through purity (I personally subscribe to C) . 

I also wanted to ask women who are “sex positive” in the sense that they have high sex drives/desire multiple partners (not in the porn sense/prostitute sense, I’m talking women who are non sex workers but have high drives) how you navigate through these systems. Have you ever questioned if your sex drives came from systems of male aggression, and if not, how do you satisfy your desires without fallinng victim to these systems. 


Lastly, I wanted to ask what practical solutions could be put in place to solve the issues above. I know that the Liberal Feminists of the 60s fought for a sexual revolution to combat purity culture while the Radical Feminists fought against porn and prostitution because of their inherent ties to male violence and commodification of women. But how do we dismantle these systems in a way that accepts female sexuality without subjecting it to male commodification or slut shaming? It’s really hard to get an answer from a lot of rad fems/ lib fems because they are more interested in explaining the problem from a nuanced perspective and its immediate solutions than imagining a larger system to replace what we have now. 


Hoping for answers to get me out of this mental block. I genuinely can’t think of anything.",2021-01-08T03:50:30.000Z,9

I am 5’ 8.5” high and 72.5 kg heavy. My short-term goal is to lose the paunch I’ve grown living a sedentary lifestyle, the long-term one to be ripped—though, not freaky ripped iykwim. 

I’ve had my sight on dragonboating for quite some time now, but there is only one in my place and I am trying to avoid someone there.

I’m having a really hard time making some sort of peace with it

I’ve got a hip that ranges from “achy” on good days to “I can hardly walk” on bad days, I’m almost certain I’ve got arthritis in my hands. I can’t sleep on my left side because it makes my shoulder hurt, if I sleep on my back I wake myself up snoring from having my nose broken so many times*. I used to lift weights and flip tires and all that shit, now I’ve got a bag of stretch bands that I carry around with me, maybe do some push ups and stuff too but that’s about all I can handle with any sort of regularity

It is the most satisfying, gratifying, and highest paying job I've had. I think where I'm getting frustrated is the hours that I spend working or away from home. 

I am a field technician for a company that tests milk at dairys in the United States. I travel to 4-5 states depending on the month. A full-time schedule for us is 16 dairys a month or 4 days a week. I have anywhere between 22-26 dairys on my schedule depending on the month. I spend at least half of my Saturdays and 1 Sunday working now. Really and honestly it wouldn't bother me that much but I am training for my first Ultra marathon and Saturdays are the longest runs of my week. 

With my work my hours are kinda crazy, sometimes I may only work 8 hours in a day but the next day I may work 17 or 21 hours and the worst part is that I feel like I'm having more long days than short days. 

Thank you in advance and sorry for any formatting errors, I'm typing this on my phone while at work after I got less than 4 hours of sleep last night.",2021-01-21T13:41:59.000Z,19

AskMen,puletu_alex_smartass,I tried to nap but instead I entered a deep relaxation mode. Why?,"So this night I slept kinda strange; I didn’t deep sleep but instead I felt like I was thinking continuously, in fact when I woke up i felt like I didn’t sleep. I felt like I teleported through time. Most of my thoughts were about the blood withdrawal I had to do this morning which induced a lot of fear in me.

So today I felt kinda sleepy indeed and I decided to nap (I always managed to nap and fall asleep in any situation but since the beginning of this year I started to have night sleep problems because of some acne antibiotics I take; in the end I recognized the problem, stopped taking them and managed to fall asleep fast at night but I somehow lost my ability to nap) but what happened was that I entered this deep relaxation mode where I felt like I was ignoring everything around me and just focusing on my thoughts; it was pretty interesting because the only way to defocus was either hearing a loud external noise or having to focus on my breathing. All this took around 45 min and after I “woke up” I felt kinda refreshed but not as refreshed as I feel after a good classic nap.

With this I’d love to hear some advice about how I can regain my ability to fall asleep and nap like a baby. I’m 18M btw.

Thank you so much! :)",2021-01-21T14:10:28.000Z,7

Recently, a male friend made it clear he considers me \"marriage material.\" I was disconcerted to discover he has a girlfriend! 

But he does not consider HER in this way, and I do not know why he is staying in a relationship with someone - if he is not serious about them. 

What makes a guy decide if you are a potential wife vs. a girlfriend? 

I'll admit, I saw it as a huge red flag to find out about the girlfriend after this convo had happened. But genuinely would like to understand more about the difference in wife vs. girlfriend decision in a man's mind - because he seems to be so definite and I'm 110% clueless as to why.

Thank you!",2021-01-07T02:22:28.000Z,71

I have a very active fight or flight response so I don’t like it when people touch me. Even when I don’t tense up cuss I catch myself before my muscles act I’m still spazzing out inside my head. 

The reasons why I emphasizes girls is because I know a lot of girls get very touchy feely when they like you. This wouldn’t be a problem since not many women like me but when they do it’s even more disturbing. The idea of someone having a crush on me or being touchy feely or giving me compliments or telling me I’m worthy of love is deeply perturbing to me since I handle none of that well.

Feminism,[deleted],Purity Balls are disgusting!,"[Purity ball - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purity_ball) 

A **purity ball** is a [formal dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(dance)) event typically practised by some conservative [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) groups in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). The events are attended by fathers and their [teenage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage) daughters in order to promote [virginity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginity) until [marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage). Typically, daughters who attend a purity ball make a [virginity pledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginity_pledge) to remain [sexually abstinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abstinence) until marriage. Fathers who attend a purity ball make a promise to protect their young daughters' \"purity of mind, body, and soul.\" 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only are purity balls creepy, but they are also very sexist, and are just giving the ideas that men should be able to control women, and that women should only be valued by their sexuality. 

Here's some YouTube videos about purity balls:

AskMen,Iam_Boo,I just accepted my dream job - how do I tell my current boss who mentored me since grad school?,"Hi guys, 

I don’t really ask for advice - but this one is hitting me a little bit hard. 

I recently got offered and accepted my absolute dream job - I work in finance and got offered an analyst role for a big bank. I currently work at a small firm, but my current boss became a good friend and mentored me in the industry for the past 2 years. I look up to this guy like a professional father figure. 

We are a small firm, and I have a ton of responsibility. I even pushed back the start date until mid February so I can continue to train the person who I anticipate will take my role. 

I fee horrible, but it is legitimately my dream job and they are also doubling my pay. I don’t really know what I’m asking for - but maybe some advice from someone who was at some time in a similar position?

Thank you guys.

Edit: I apologize I should have been more clear - my current boss is the majority owner of the firm!

Hi Guys - I just woke up and saw a ton of responses! I just wanted to say thank you very much! Each person had great advice and I will give an update tomorrow night when I speak with him!",2021-01-03T00:17:38.000Z,72

She confided that I was her first the first time we did it. Im 26 and shes 27. It was slow going in the beginning but she seems to have gotten the hang of sex and now its a lot better. The only problem is that she is completely silent during the act. No moans or any dirty talk whatsoever. She also doesn't make any faces that would show she is feeling good. She just keeps her eyes closed and stays silent. Ive asked her if she enjoys it and she says she does and I've encouraged her to communicate if it feels good/uncomfortable or if she wants to try anything out. But she doesnt really say what she wants. How can I get her to open up and be more enthusiastic during sex? I find it very hot when a girl makes noise and moans during sex but I cant get a peep out of her. I need help lol. Thanks guys.,2021-01-02T21:30:13.000Z,36

AskMen,cccbig,how do you protect yourselves from the evil that deranged people do online?,"Im writing after reading [this] (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/technology/change-my-google-results.html)

It is simply depressing the amount of Karens and Kevins there are, people not mature enough to accept that not everybody agrees with you, that you didn't get a job because well, you weren't good enough, that you got fired because you were a drug addict, that you didn't get a house for the price you wanted because somebody else was paying more, the amount of people that hold grudges for decades to come...

Yet in this day and age, everyone can claim you are a pedophile, a rapist, a drug addict or a dealer, that you cheated or that you abuse you parents.

And they get away with it. Companies only care about clickbait and hide behind freedom of speech or not wanting to censor every post each user posts.

It wouldn't be such a big issue if it hadn't consequences in real life, but nowadays so many employers do a quick internet search before hiring anybody, and if they see any red flag like rapist, drugs, pedophile, they don't inquire more, they simply move on. Because, how many employers are going to corroborate what an anonymous user claims on facebook or in a forum with the local police department?

So, how do you protect yourselves from the evil that deranged people do online?",2021-01-31T22:33:45.000Z,2

AskMen,[deleted],What can I do about feeling undesired?,"I'm in college right now, everyone is in a relationship and I've tried with 3 girls that I had feelings for in the previous years. I wasnt desperate these feelings developed slowly, and when I got the courage to ask them out, I was rejected. I know rejection is normal and that the pain is natural. I dont have a problem with any of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is with feeling wanted. I've been bullied for as long as I can remember since I was 12. I didnt have a real friend until I was 14 and she was my best friend who had left me when I was 16. Since then I havent really had any true friends, just classmates and acquaintances. I've tried to be friends with my classmates, I reach out to them, when I get the chance and talk to them, but its always me having to contact them. They never reach out to me or invite me to anything or even just to talk. I did an experiment a few months ago where I just stopped contacting all my \"friends\" for a month and a half. And none of them even texted to see how I was doing. I met a girl in my first year of college who was my only friend, someone who consistently reached out to me, but I had started developing feelings for her after a year. When I asked her on a date she rejected. And stopped talking to me shortly after. The same thing happened with the 3rd girl, and the second girl was just a classmate who I thought was attractive and asked to grab a coffee to get to know each other (she rejected). So i've just been alone these past few months with my art, and classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have to learn to be alone and thats what I've been doing for quite along time but now its just really hurting me. I get discouraged from trying to make friends now because anytime I do I feel left out of a conversation, or just not invited to go to events. No one has asked to hang out with me, and I feel really unwanted right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know if this is a natural feeling for a man or something but it really hurts and I dont know how to deal with it.",2021-01-27T07:45:00.000Z,12

I let a lot of things go, especially being disrespected in the craziest ways (getting cursed at, she would do some unloyal type behavior) and I always ended up letting her off easy and I felt it built a type of undesirable behavior pattern moving forward.

Today, I was called a nickname that I did not like, told her on the phone I did not like being called that very clearly. She decided to call me the nickname again in text and I said what? And she said, \"I'll call you that as long as I think of a new nickname for you\" and I said no, I really don't like being called that. I think she got a little salty or upset but that was that. In the future, how should I deal with some kind of behavior I don't like to get maximum compliance without going back to old patterns?

Now as someone who's bored relatively easily and is naturally competitive and motivated by things that stretch me, I've always tended to be quite ambitious in terms of my career. I have managed to 'climb the ladder' over the years relatively fast both in terms of role and compensation but also, perhaps more importantly, in terms of challenges and responsibilities. 

Now because of family reasons that I can't ignore, I've found myself in a position (literally - geographically - and figuratively) where there is far, far less scope for advancement, I'm hours and hours away from any of the centres for my industry and there just isn't the challenges of scale or market to keep me occupied.

I'm not a work drone; in non-Covid times, I've got a relatively busy and varied social life and hobbies going on, I work out, I have the financial stability to do nice things and go to nice places and so on. It's not a case of feeling empty because work is all I have - I'm happy enough with my life outside work, but I have a nagging feeling that I've now more or less hit a brick wall career-wise, even in a world of remote working (I am in the boonies far too far to be able to travel for necessary in-person parts of my job; my sector so far generally seems to be offering flexible, part-remote and part-on-site working rather than fully remote).

So, I'm curious if anyone else who has been quite career-driven has any advice for going through this decompression period into letting it take a back seat, and being ok with that?",2021-01-26T23:24:07.000Z,1

Feminism,seni300,Letting Go,"Good day. I'm 30 year old man and about to have a daughter. I look forward to having her. I intend to bring her up well and appropriately. Based of statistics she is like to face a lot of challenges in life a a black girl/woman. I'm currently in the process of rewiring my brain to see the things that I have been missing or seen as normal. I don't want to beat around the bush. Nor do I want to be seen negative so please forgive me as I am learning. 

The main thing is how do I avoid my daughter form being over sexualised. I'm not trying to make her like Rapunzel and lock her from the world but I am afraid of the world and its effects on girls. Like I'm scared/worries that she may become a visual meal for men and how social media and the internet are there are other women that validate that. Like I guess I just want her to be successful with her brain and primarily not because of her looks. 

I don't know maybe I'm overthinking. But I've was part of the system of social media etc and I've left and I know the many possibilities that there are.",2021-01-26T23:52:14.000Z,18

I (F) tend to let men down by ghosting them. I think I tend to do this because  one: I get too nervous/scared to say anything straight up, and two: I feel like it’s mean. But when I think about it, I kind of feel like there’s a lack of respect when you just ghost someone. But then another part of me feels like I don’t have to explain myself to anyone, and I also don’t want to cause hurt feelings.

AskMen,wyldeslash,Do you have any recommendations for a print media magazine subscription? what do you like and why?,"I am looking for some recommendations for a print magazine subscription that will basically have the good reddit content I like but would force me to actual read the content instead of headlines and comments.

Lately I feel like my attention span for reading has really gone downhill, I have been a somewhat heavy user/lurker for 8+ years now and I feel like I have conditioned myself to glance read the headline, maybe comments if they are juciy and then skip to the next thing and remembering nothing of any value or substance from it. There probably other ways to solve this but I liked a magazine subscription previous and I think it might help its like a monthly present I forgot was coming. 

I have previously subscribed to National Geographic and I really liked it, it is a contender. I have also looked at new scientist and the economist but I am not sure if that would be to complex/dry for me. What do you read and why?

AskMen,Genticles,What's the most embarrassing thing you've heard said during a teleconference meeting?,"I had joined a meeting today at work and I guess Teams didn't automatically mute my mic. I said that I wasn't sure what the point of this meeting for most people was as 90% of people on the call never said anything and it lasted two hours. There were about 30 people on the call and I didn't realize I was unmuted until a coworker messaged me saying they muted my mic. At the end of the meeting, the facilitator thanked me for the feedback. At that point I just wanted to die.

Does anybody have any stories where something similar happened to them or a coworker? I'm just trying to make myself feel better at this point.",2021-01-13T22:05:09.000Z,2

AskMen,00tyredditor93,Men you noticed other men are increasingly malicious about other men’s heights ? Why is this?,"Perhaps it’s just my perceptions, but Ive noticed a trend recently where a lot of guys seems to be acting like short men are subhuman. It seems really common amongst young men at the moment. 

Obviously men rip the piss out each other from a young age, but there seems to be a growth of an actual, malicious attitude towards short men amongst some guys. 

I can’t fathom this personally. Obviously, short men draw the short straw when it comes to women, but as we all know most woman will find some aspect of you to comment on to test your worth, few generally are malicious towards short guys. 

So what gives, has anyone else noticed this? I can’t figure out an explanation for it, where I come from there was always an understanding that patter is one thing but generally a man doesn’t attack another mans ( or group of men’s) character or status for absolutely no reason , or to make themselves seem better. It has always been seen as petty and unattractive. It seems like that’s changing though.

AskMen,carbonironandzinc,Date ideas when we can't meet in person?,"Yes I've seen the pinned post, I'm not asking about going on a physical date. I hope this question isn't also disallowed.

I've already 'met' someone. We did a date on zoom a couple of days ago, and in spite of everything it went really well and we both agreed to a second date this Friday. But I don't just want to do another sit down in front of a screen and make small talk thing. I usually do some activity or outing on second dates. How can we simulate this, or at least do something that isn't just a video call from our bedrooms?

Also, is this even a viable way of beginning any kind of relationship at all? Even if we have a dozen more dates I won't be able to hold her hand or kiss her. I am worried that it's not really possible to romantically escalate things when you can't even meet in person. Not touching is bad enough, but even a date where you a socially distanced would be better than nothing, but we can't even do that.

TL;DR what are some 'remote' date ideas, and how do you keep a potential romance going when you haven't met yet and might not be able to meet for a while, or is it impossible?

Feminism,thunderkoka,"My mom’s boyfriend made a misogynistic comment, I tried to speak to my mom about it and now she won’t talk to me","Just kind of venting a little bit to maybe a community that might now how much it does matter. Basically my mom’s bf and his daughter (18f) were leaving our house, and my mom was there, and so was I (20f), my sister (18f), and my sister’s boyfriend (18m).

The boys were talking about trying to get some close friends together to play some hockey, and my sister was mentioning some girls that might be interested, too. I don’t know the exact context but my mom made some kind of “like a girl” comment in terms of girls’ abilities playing hockey, to which my sister and I said it was wrong to say. Then my mom’s bf started getting into it saying it’s true, and said something about let’s put a hockey stick in a girl’s hand and see what happens. What made me more angry is he didn’t even want to have a conversation about it, but talked over us, saying “I’m right” over and over again, even after he had left and shut the door (that’s what my sister said she heard).

I was still pretty upset about it later, and brought up to my mom that I don’t think my relationship can ever grow to be more with him after making those comments. On the two occasions that day I tried to talk to her about it, she was very upset with what I was saying and said things like “back in our day these things were okay to say,” and how my generation is “extremely sensitive.”

I never cared what her opinions are, and don’t care that she thinks what he said was fine, what bothered me was that in trying to talk to her and explain that he had crossed boundaries I’ve set for myself, it seemed like she was just trying to convince me otherwise. She had just been talking the other day that she wishes I would feel like I can talk to her more, but now it just seems she only wants my happiness as long as it satisfies hers.

The biggest part of all this for me is that I’m proud of myself for setting these boundaries, and I refuse to be complacent just to make other people happy. I’ll continue to be nice and have conversations with my mom’s bf, obviously, but the conversation was just to mention to her that I could not have a deeper connection with him than that. And now I have barely made eye contact with her in the last few days. I don’t see us talking before I go back to the city.",2021-01-06T04:41:47.000Z,49

Feminism,jadedgirl3011,Thoughts on the institution of marriage?,"I am 19F. 

Recently, I’ve stumbled upon a very interesting take/discussion on marriage. It says that marriage is an outdated institution that was born of patriarchy. And that women even “choosing” to marry are doing it not out of their choice but because of a certain social conditioning. Someone put all this up (this is the gist of it) on their story and they have like 25K followers, and responses started pouring in. A very common response was that even though they married someone they loved and still do, marriage wasn’t required at all and that “the concept of marriage needs to die a natural death.”

I identify as a feminist but for some reason, I cannot understand and agree with this school of thought. I do understand that marriage was the result of patriarchy, as a move to ensure that women are always below and behind men; but that does not have to hold true for today and the future, right? For example, I, as an individual, don’t plan to marry just anyone for the sake of it, but if I do find someone I love and want to spend my life with, while maintaining my independence, I would like to marry them, settle down into a family, or what is the traditional form of a family.

What are your thoughts on this? I know I am quite young to be thinking about marriage, but I’m just kinda confused and this topic is gaining a lot of attention now so I thought I’d take the point of view of this sub as well. 

Thank you!",2021-01-06T04:54:29.000Z,16

AskMen,WildernessPilgrim,How do I start developing self love?,"I grew up in an abusive environment that caused me to strive for perfection in fear of being abused and I have a very low self esteem as a result. My trauma has ultimately affected my relationships with friends and romantic interests, the latter being the focus of this post.

It takes me forever to move one from someone, even when I know that they have no interest in me romantically, yet I still plan things in my head that are clearly out my way just to cheer them up. Whenever I see them happy with someone else I begin to spiral. I know that everyone is free to choose who they're interested in, and that there shouldn't be an obligation to give me a shot just because we're friends. It really bothers me that my lack of self-worth and feeling like I am yet again insufficient for someone I care about suck the life out of me.

The fact of the matter is that I know I deserve to be loved and have many desirable traits and accomplishments that a lot of people would like, but I have difficulty putting my beliefs into practice. I'm really just tired of being stuck in a loop where I feel like it's 1 step forward and 2 steps back whenever I see them and it's been going on for over a year now.",2021-01-13T04:44:00.000Z,27

AskMen,Key-Contract-9672,How do you balance between being assertive and not coming across as overly angry/sensitive?,"As a child I was the kind of person who, if someone accidentally bumped against me, would take it personally and angrily demand blood. Parents and teachers eventually tempered me into realizing that not every discomfort means I have been grievously wronged. These lessons combined with abusive parents (who taught me that I didn't have a right to want anything and that I was always in the wrong) have conditioned me to automatically concede when someone shows discomfort or resistance; even when I'm in the right and just standing up for myself. Even still, I can come across as angry when I'm not trying to be due to deep voice, bitch face, and stature and I have accidentally instigated arguments with people who thought I was being rude.

If someone gets irritated, disagrees with me, glosses over my concerns, or challenges me on something that I deserve out of fairness, I immediately pull back and apologize. I always feel that I shouldn't be angry, that I should try and diffuse the situation, that I don't have a right to stand up for myself.

I'm also a very direct and goal-oriented person, and sometimes I believe that backing down will resolve the conversation more quickly and I can move on to my next \"quest\". I think this contributes to me seeking the path of least resistance.

However now I realize that at times I'm being taken advantage of because I now always try to diffuse the situation and avoid conflict. I always realize it after the fact, but my problem now is that it's still my immediate thought to cower down when someone challenges me. How do I become more assertive *in the moment* and realize when it's ok to push back?",2021-01-06T03:49:44.000Z,7

AskMen,Voytila,How do you deal with constantly seeing women as potential partners?,"I thought back about the time I participated in Krav Maga classes about a year ago and I noticed that once I met a cute girl there I was often chatting with her during classes and looking forward to meeting her there. What I totally forgot is why I was there in the first place: TO LEARN KRAV MAGA.

When thinking about it I noticed that in general whenever a woman seems somewhat interesting to me I easily lose focus and think about the things it could lead to, instead of just enjoying the moment.

AskMen,AMermaidsTear,What does a chivalrous man want from a relationship with a lady?,"I met a chivalrous man recently. He opens door for me and walks me back whenever we are out. It is true that \"manners make a man\". He is kind and sensitive. He also has some traditional beliefs that as a male, he should be providing for the female. He cares about my enjoyment in bed.

So far, I like spending time with him and will like to know him better. But so far, he has been a little guarded and did not talk much about his feelings or our relationship.

So calling all chivalrous men out there, can you kindly tell me what do you want from a relationship? What do you hope that a lady would provide you with?

Edit 1: He is totally alright with the female having career ambitions and supporting herself financially and emotionally. However, he is willing to step in and help, should she need help. Maybe I was not being clear before that. 

Edit 2: I know every guy is different. I will ask him, but my purpose of writing this thread is to have an expectation. I don't know what to expect when I discuss this topic with him.",2021-01-27T14:02:52.000Z,23

AskMen,_Aero6351_,How do I accept someone else's past?,"I've been dating this girl for a couple months now and it seems almost perfect. However the other day I learned some things about her past that when I first heard about, had really taken me back. 

 I grew up pretty judgmental and its an issue I've been working on for years, and I've come very far! But this one gets to me.  Like I understand that we all have a past and aren't necessarily proud of some of the things we've done. I can also see that this has never affected our relationship and she is the same girl I still love. 

This isn't an issue thats tied to just this relationship either. I've had many friends that I find something out about them and it changes my perspective on them even though it shouldn't. I can convince my mind that they have a right to have a past and that I shouldn't let that affect my relationship with them but everytime I think about it, it churns my stomach. It feels like I'm involuntarily letting it affect my relationship with them. 

How do I move past this? How can I grow as a person and accept people for who they are and who they WERE, because there's a difference and I realize that. I don't want to let a choice that SHE made long before I was even in her life soil an otherwise fantastic relationship. I'm scared it will and I need help, please.

Edit: like I said this isn't just dedicated to my SO but rather just relationships in general. Also the things that I'm talking about are socially acceptable and if it were some random person I wouldn't think twice about it. But for some reason it just bothers me and I can't even tell why.",2021-01-09T21:02:20.000Z,44

You're supposed to be able to talk openly about these issues with people like family, partner, friends... but I feel like it's harder to talk about this with them than with strangers, and it's not because they're not good for me, I'm close to my family and my girlfriend is a kind and great woman, but I can't bring myself to talk to them about my deepest struggles. 

So I want to ask other men how they dealt or are dealing with this.

AskMen,Grit-Bone,Men! Can we have an open and honest discussion about cleaning up and grooming? What does every man need to know?,"Not a lot of attention goes into dressing well, grooming well, cologne, lotions, shampoos, etc collectively; and most guys just \"figure it out\" or do whatever they've always done or whatever their lady suggests. I know there are some guys that rarely even wash their hands, so grooming and self care isn't very high on our priority list typically. But I submit my personal experience similar to that of Bill Burr, who had no clue skin \"dried out\" and that lotion was not just for girls. After this I started paying closer attention to skin care, facial care, hair care, looking and smelling good, grooming my beard, learning which colognes actually smell good, or better together, and to use much less of them, among other \"hacks\" that make my quality of life so much better as a man.

What are the best \"grooming hacks\" all men need to know?",2021-01-28T20:45:58.000Z,52

The album Celebrity Skin also had a lot of great songs like Awful, Hit So Hard, Reasons to be Beautiful, Use Once and Destroy. Not to mention her solo album and Nobody’s Daughter also have good empowering tracks on them.

I was just wondering if any of you all still listen to her music and/or love it as much as I do. Courtney gets a bad rap and somewhat rightfully so but her music and message cannot be denied. She was and is a badass.",2021-01-29T10:07:03.000Z,4

AskMen,wavecycle,How crazy does your SO get during her period?,"Do any of you have a Doctor Jeckyll Mrs Hyde situation going on? Is it being handled and would you call the relationship healthy anyway?

I recently started dating a woman I've been friends with for a couple months before that. Things had been going well and we have a good friendly relationship. 

This weekend she suddenly became hypersensitive and highly critical of my behaviour.

After a while I realised that these issues seem to be driven more by emotional upset than actual problems, possibly compounded by the fact that she is premenstrual and there is a lot of background covid related stress going on. Also she only has a period once every 3 months due to her medication.

What followed felt like a stream of unhappiness and criticism of me: what i had done wrong, what i should have done, what I said wrong, what I should have said. 

I asked her what type of response she wanted from me given her current emotional situation, and she said something like encouraging/ consoling. I explained that if you want a friendly response from me, then being hypercritical of me is the wrong way to go as it just puts me on the defensive. 

Still it came so I said \"No more, I'm not doing this line of communication\".

Men, do you face this kind of swing in behaviour and are you managing to deal with it in a healthy constructive way? How?!? Thanks",2021-01-11T06:20:55.000Z,14

I work out around 4pm, but I feel a little discouraged thinking that it’s not as good for me as  6am or so.

If I’m eating relatively healthy and working out 4-5-6 times a week, should I still be good to get a pretty good physique? I’m 5’11 and 185 so extremely average size lol

Feminism,Niandra_1312,Failure in contraceptive pills in Chile causes unwanted pregnancies. Abortion is illegal.,"Hello, this is my first post, please if this was already shared, feel free to delete it.

I wanted to share with you something terrible that happened in my country, Chile, last October and November. Contraceptive pills with failures were distributed in the country, 3 brands involved. Some where distributed for sale and withdrawn because they were made with lower doses, hence ineffecy, and some bigger negligence was committed: the Government distributed amongst lower income women through the public health system, some contraceptive pills that contained placebo, that resulted in unwanted pregnancies. In Chile, all abortion is illegal, unless it's the result of a rape, the fetus has a condition incompatible with extrauterine life or the mother is in a life threating situation (under 12 weeks exclusively). Of course this negligence by the Big Pharma and the Government of Piñera administration doesn't allow abortions for the affected women. I wasn't able to find an article or news coverage in English.

Thank you for this space.

AskMen,[deleted],What are some ways I can be happy when all else fails?,"Dear Men of Reddit, 

As the title states, I need some advice. Quarantine has been rough on everyone, I included, and I could really use some help. I have been stuck inside due to the virus and spend 2/3 of my day either in class or doing work for class. In the offtime that I have, I spend it doing tasks like laundry, cooking, cleaning, etc. Everyone online recommends working out, so I started doing intense HIIT training as well as weights. While at first picking up a hobby was a nice refresher, instead of becoming an enjoyable escape, it mends into the rest of my otherwise copy-paste lifestyle. Every day since last March has felt the exact same. Hobbies don't do it for me anymore, playing videogames or watching television aren't enjoyable, and all the other healthy habits that the internet offers usually have to do with \"go visit a friend\" or \"interact with a group of people...\" Motivation doesn't carry me to do things anymore, only the ever-looming threat of how my actions impact my physical/economic future are able to get me to do well. Also loneliness from not having a significant other leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Any advice on how to keep myself grounded in reality and enjoy the time I have would be appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to listen to me,

Sincerely,

A Necromancer",2021-01-14T07:11:03.000Z,20

She normally joked with me and occasionally too peeks at me, but whenever I appeared nervous about something, she was more prone to staring at me for long periods of time (she also had this smirk on her face...you know the one), or more prone to touching me in a playful manner whenever I would stutter or freeze up. Also especially liked calling me cute whenever I stuttered

TL;DR: Manager who has a thing for me calls me cute and makes ga-ga eyes at me whenever I was shy or awkward. Dumbass me couldn't see it until after leaving that place

What about you guys?

Edit: I'm aware that a woman into shy guys isn't THAT weird, but it's definitely a minority taste (hence, unconventional)

If so what can I do?,"TL;DR: Met a girl through school who I wanted a relationship with, she sort of friendzoned me and I decided to move on forward, my friend thinks I am desperate, am I desperate? What can I do about it?

I met a girl through school who I thought was pretty cool, I have being wanting to get into a relationship with someone and she seemed like a good choice, my life has been going well recently with me focusing on my self. All that was missing is somebody to love and share my happiness with, I have asked this girl out a few times before but she never gave a straight answer and it felt like I was being friendzoned but I wasn't sure.

I decided to be forward and ask her if she wanted a relationship with me and she said some things which confirmed to me that she doesn't, I told her that I'm glad I got confirmation so now I can move on. (I'm not trying to be friends with her)

I talked about it with a friend who I usually talk to about these sort of things and he said that I was rushing it too much and that I seemed desperate when all I was doing was being forward so I didn't have to waste my or the girls time with confusion and just waiting to see if a relationship would happen.

I didn't feel any particular way about it, infact I was relieved that I didn't have to try to impress her or make her like me anymore, that was until my friend said those things and now I am doubting myself.",2021-01-23T16:13:37.000Z,39

Feminism,AnKeWa,The enforcement of FFP2 masks over community masks discriminates against women.,"In Bavaria (province of Germany), it was recently decided that we are to wear FFP2 masks instead of community masks in public transport and supermarkets. The decision was made against the recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute, which is a government agency that researches disease control and prevention.

The reasoning of our Minister-President, Markus Söder, is that the FFP2 masks will prevent an infection for the carrier of the mask as well as for their environment. That is true, if the mask is worn correctly.

However, when I, a woman, wear a standard FFP2 mask, it is too big for my face. The mask is gaping at the chin and nose, even when using one of those masks with a metallic strip in it. Today, I noticed that I am not the only woman with this problem. The masks are gaping for all women I saw, while they do not gape for men. With my FFP2 mask, I am practically raw dogging train air. With the community mask I sewed myself, I never had this problem.

My assumption is that the size of the masks are standardized to fit onto men's faces, as so many things are in our world. I am now stuck with buying special FFP2 masks made for my face, which will cost me more money. Friendly reminder here that women are, on average, much poorer than men due to a lot of women's work being unpaid and/or underpaid.

I can practically see already how in two weeks, headlines will read \"Women in Bavaria are having way higher Covid numbers than men! Why are women being so careless and irresponsible?!\".

In case you want to read more about it: https://themunicheye.com/ffp2-masks-now-compulsory-on-public-transport-3913

EDIT: I am not against wearing a mask. I want the proper fitting masks available for women at the same price as the men's masks, and I want my government to listen to the scientists.",2021-01-18T06:29:27.000Z,27

Feminism,mlgamerpmn,For any queer south asian women that may by part of this group. A new space for you to connect with the community incase you're feeling alone / minority 🌈♥️✌🏽,"It always fascinates me that although there are millions of south asians in the world we are still a minority group in the queer community. 

A lot of us may want to remain anonymous, are late bloomers, may be confused by heteronormativity in south asian culture or totally deny this part of their identity.

I get it.
I understand.
It's hard.
And it's frustrating. 

But I'm determined to make a little space for us on the wonderful world of Reddit so we don't need to feel alone. 

Introducing: 
[r/QueerDesiWomen](https://np.reddit.com/r/QueerDesiWomen)

A space where we can dwell into this part of our identity without feeling judged. If you know someone in real life also that would benefit from this space then please get them here too! 

Plus south asian women are amazing! We're smart and beautiful. So this group of wonderful people deserve to meet more of us. Please get started by introducing yourself in the space We're all interested to learn about each other. 

Also, if you know someone on Reddit who identifies this way then I ask you to please reach out and share this space with them so we can try and expand this group as quickly as possible. 

I already know people have tried to make a group before and its been pretty dead but I'm determined to succeed here. So, wish me luck 🥳

If you join then I'll say thank you in advance ✌🏽

Lastly, I am sending love to anyone and everyone who reads this post 🌈

PS: I'm fairly new to Reddit so if you'd like to help me spread the word or contribute then let me know.",2021-01-14T09:31:57.000Z,3

We've been having sex 4 times a week, and yesterday I couldn't even get hard properly so we didn't have sex and she was really upset, she got angry and cried. Nevertheless we're supposed to have sex tomorrow, and I don't know what to do... 
Is this because I'm exhausted of some sort? 
This is kinda urgent, and I have a day left. So please tell me how you fixed that issue, as I think many men go through same things in life at some point.

AskMen,trapper_bub,What are emotional needs? And how do I figure mine out?,"I often times end up in unrequited love scenarios. I want to  be a womans friend before simply boning them because I want to be seen and appreciated for the human that I am not just my nice shoulders, beard, and biceps. I don't want to require anything from them though because I often feel like asking anyone for anything would be rude or burdensome. 

This often leads to me agreeing to be friends first. Which leads to her losing interest and finding interest somewhere else. 


I dont date often, I was social distancing before it was cool, and I moved to the middle of bum fuck no where at age 25 for an okay stable government job that puts me in the outdoors where I belong. 

I've spent really my whole life socially and emotionally isolated. 

My understanding is if you wish to break this pattern and attract someone worthy of soulmatehood (or at least a healthy partnership), is to know your needs so you can stand up for them in the relationship. 

So I guess my question is how do you learn what your emotional needs are? How do I determine these in the context of my self imposed isolation.

I dont want to fall in love... but I recognize the importance of that and desire my perception of what that is greatly.",2021-01-12T11:54:31.000Z,50

Feminism,veritosophy,"\"Beaten by a girl\" on tasks that don't depend on physical strength","I would think it would be understandable if someone jokes around with an average guy for losing (say) an arm wrestle to a an average woman. Your average man is clearly physically bigger and stronger, so that speaks to this particular guy's lack of strength. If you find issue with this part, please let me know.



What strikes me as wrong is when this is said in any other type of task, like strategy games. Just today a girl I was playing with was beating someone in a strategy game and people shamed the guy and blamed his anger on him losing \"to a girl\". That, to me, speaks to a lingering sexist ideal that's been internalised by our culture. Even if nowadays it's unacceptable to directly insult a woman because of her sex, it's somehow okay to degrade males if they perform worse than a woman in a number of tasks. 



Do you have anything similar to share?


EDIT: I thought a little more about about the first paragraph and I think that even if a man loses to a girl in (say) arm wrestling, saying \"you just got beaten by a girl\" would still reinforce a stereotype and that catch phrase, so in an ideal scenario it wouldn't be used. I might be going too far though.",2021-01-03T03:23:48.000Z,47

46 months? Lol WTF? It’s so not fair 
[Hong Kong police officer gets 46 months jail for sexually assaulting 6 underage girls](https://hongkongfp.com/2021/01/28/hong-kong-police-officer-gets-46-months-jail-for-sexually-assaulting-6-underage-girls/)

He has served in HK police force for like 12 years. I think he know better than anyone else what should be done , what is correct.

It seems to me that this he deserves a life imprisonment😀",2021-01-28T10:23:09.000Z,3

On the contrary in the feminist literature (e.g. Andrea Dworkin's *Woman Hating*) there appears the idea that women *should* literally liberate their bodies and start *living* in them. Most women say feminism is about choice, and people could *choose* doing all these, but I'm not really sure there *is* a choice. I like to hear other people's opinions. Particularly I would like to be referred to other people who have written from this stance, hear people who have struggled with this issue personally (either as a man\\* or a woman).

If so, how long does it normally take? Or if not, do you constantly compare your first love to current lovers?

EDIT: a lot of you have said that you haven’t heard of this saying, well that isn’t very surprising but I have heard it in movies and sometimes posts were it got at least 100k likes. [Here are some insights](https://youtu.be/rfxlUZpLEPA) 

EDIT (1): Some of you have pointed out why I decided to ask this question while I am the first love. I don’t know really. The quote just got to my mind and it’s stuck. I am the first love and long term (3 years now). A lot of things have changed and I figured if we ever break up, I’m gonna have a very hard time moving on since this relationship took a lot from me.

AskMen,coachfabia,How does man develop a well information world view of the world?,"Hello World,

I am someone who's always enjoyed History class - but never studied past any mandatory courses. I've seen a few documentaries on WWI and WW2. But overall, my knowledge of history is quite scattered and random - at best I could score high than an average person on historic trivia - but don't really posses any meaningful knowledge.

Some contemporary issues I'm interested are things like US Politics and the current political climate. I'm interested in human rights - including things like BLM and the LGBTQ movement - as well learning about the radical right. Part of me want to jump into specific documentaries on these topics.

But I feel like I want to start from the past - further back. Understand these common themes through a more ancient and primitives' lens. Like - what were the political systems in the past - which ones worked - and which ones did not? Were their parallels events in history that match todays political climate? What does the French revolution tell us about our current political climate?

I just have some desire to get broader contextual understanding of the world. I'm looking to learn about this in the most digestible way (even though it makes me vulnerable to confirmation bias). So if you could recommend podcasts, documentaries and the like, that would be much much appreciated.

In a way - i want to re-learn history - in a way that is much more valuable.

Thanks and Happy new year!",2021-01-01T15:33:11.000Z,20

In it, one of the grim pieces of folklore is that a man saw a seal turn into a woman, stole her seal skin, and forced her into marriage with children. Eventually she gets her skin back and escapes. 

Now I know the storytelling/characterization of myths is inherently vastly different from how real people would react to these hypotheticals and that this situation is uncomfortably close to real life ordeals and shouldn't be made light of, but I can't help a curiosity about how real people would feel in that situation.",2021-01-01T12:17:37.000Z,231

AskMen,betterme2610,"Well, I’m officially divorcing. It feels like a life redo button, now what?","After a very hard 1 1/2 years trying to work through things, my wife and I are finally divorcing.  We are so far off base and she’s changed so much (not for my better) that it’s time.  Papers get signed tomorrow.  I’m 29, great job, good health, cute pup, and I’ll have some income with the sale of our house.  I feel a pretty large weight lifting off of me, as I’ve been on the back burner for a very long time.  I’m trying to treat this like a complete life reset.  Meeting women isn’t a problem for me, at least it hasn’t been during the separation phase, I imagine it’ll be even easier once I have no baggage.  But what are some things or adventures you’d dream of going on or doing?  I’m pretty wide open and willing to try anything right now!  I think for once in my life I’m going to live for exclusively me for a bit.  Maybe disappear into the woods for a month haha.

Thanks!

Edit addition: Ok, I feel like I need to clarify here on the getting girls comment.  (Which I changed girls to women since people have a problem with that) Honestly.. my self worth did diminish a ton over this.  The back story being.. my wife determined she’s gay.  All of the counseling, separations, talks, back and fourths, boundary pushing, hurtful conversations and behaviors really gets to you over the course of a 1 1/2 year stint.  On one hand, it’s great she figured it out for herself.  But it’s really left me feeling pretty inadequate and honestly ugly in many ways through this process.  Especially in the ways she handled it.  The pain of feeling not enough really stinks. Never mind the distance and lack of intimacy all while she begged to go out and be intimate with others.  When I downloaded apps to see, or just started asking for numbers during the separation, it really perked me up and made me realize that maybe I am desirable after all and worthy of someone who clicks with me on my level and can be compatible when I’m ready.  I felt very imprisoned in this.  I’m sorry I came off as a pompous ass.  I do have needs, I do want to mingle around.  But ultimately, I want to work on me, continue to grow be it mentally, and physically in the gym, and go on many adventures!  

I will say this experience has shown me what questions to ask and things to work on when I am ready for something serious.  I’m 💯 in therapy and have been since the beginning of this process.  I also just had all my wisdom teeth pulled two hours ago and am handling all of this solo.  Because I’m a independent man, damnit.  I appreciate all of the thoughtful messages, and comments.  This is .. still tough and it comes in waves of highs and lows.  I ultimately just want to make lemonade from lemons and create the best life for me now.   Much brotherly love to all of you!",2021-01-21T16:58:46.000Z,415

Feminism,noxiclena,Boyfriend making sexist remarks ‘to trigger me’. Thoughts?,"So my boyfriend is (usually) very supportive. He is also definitely not misogynistic, he is respectful of women and feminist on most issues. We often have this conflict about what he calls his ‘humor’ though. He would make this very hyperbolic remark, something that doesn’t fit his true views at all. Like he would comment on a bad driver being a woman, or be like “probably because she’s a woman” for failures by women. I truly believe he doesn’t believe this, but he says he says these things to ‘trigger me’, since I am indeed a feminist and very annoyed by these remarks. He thinks this annoyance is funny. However sometimes I do more than rolling my eyes and actually start ranting about what he says not being okay. Then we usually fight. 

I personally think it’s not okay. Both what he says and wanting to see me ‘triggered’ for his amusement. I also generally hate the ‘it’s just a joke, don’t overreact’ attitude. 

I’m just looking for thoughts because he is still defending it as ‘his sense of humor’ and he might have a point too. He always assures me he’s feminist and he is also making fun of people saying these things unironically. What do you think? And if you think it’s not okay do you have any rational arguments for me to use to explain him this can’t just pass as ‘humor’?",2021-01-27T20:07:51.000Z,29

She is 19 years younger than me, I am not sure if it is age, I just know I do not share the same feelings. When we go out she orders a lot of shots and then the I love you's start flying. I am trying to help her not drink as much, getting her to drink some water before doing her 3rd shot but she is stubborn. She does not drink that much otherwise, only when we seem to go out.

\\-------

Adding a little more context from one of my replies:

She's always drunk when she says it. I don't see a problem dating people with the end goal not being married, I have no interest in getting married or having kids. To add a little more clarity, she splits rent with her ex-boyfriend who no longer lives in the apartment. I told her to move out since he has been known to show up there causing her to couch surf, she wants nothing to do with him. Until she sorts that part of her life out, she won't be hearing those 3 little words from me.",2021-01-18T12:19:14.000Z,312

I pay attention to be more communicative about the things that I like about him, mostly with my actions, but I want to be more vocal without sounding too aggressive or insincere.

AskMen,thedardur,How do I cope with craving intimacy?,"Sorry if this violates any of the sub's rules, I just wanted to share and thought of nowhere better than asking my fellow mates about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just realized how much I crave and miss real intimacy.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a girl at work I really fancied and really got an attraction vibe from, she left kind of early while I was busy so I didn't really have any chance to speak to her too much and figure out if she's available in any way or try to get her number.

&amp;#x200B;

It got me thinking and I realized it's been so long since I had any real intimacy, and it broke me.

It's not like I didn't have sex since my ex and I broke up, it's been two years already and I've been with plenty women since, but after thinking about it I don't remember the last time I've had intimate intercourse with a women who was as attracted to me as I was to her, with which I've had a real love connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Heck, it's been so long I don't even remember if I had that connection and intimacy with my ex when we slept together.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fine with my life but jesus, do I wish I could have that connection soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you ever get the feeling you're missing that kind of intimacy? How the hell do I cope with it?

Thanks for listening my friends

Edit: Went to sleep early so I can go surfing before work and I just saw this blew up. I don't have time to read and answer all of the questions right now, but promise to answer all of them after work.

From what I read there are so many people feeling the same as me and it makes me feel less isolated and alone in my struggles. I appreciate every single comment and advice and wish everyone that took time to share a wonderful week.

Thank you so much everyone!",2021-01-31T15:24:59.000Z,474
