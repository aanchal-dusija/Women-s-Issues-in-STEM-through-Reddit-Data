    "text": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\nWarning: package 'gt' was built under R version 4.2.2\n\ngt(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      mpg\n      cyl\n      disp\n      hp\n      drat\n      wt\n      qsec\n      vs\n      am\n      gear\n      carb\n    \n  \n  \n    21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n    21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n    22.8\n4\n108.0\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n    21.4\n6\n258.0\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n    18.7\n8\n360.0\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n    18.1\n6\n225.0\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n1\n    14.3\n8\n360.0\n245\n3.21\n3.570\n15.84\n0\n0\n3\n4\n    24.4\n4\n146.7\n62\n3.69\n3.190\n20.00\n1\n0\n4\n2\n    22.8\n4\n140.8\n95\n3.92\n3.150\n22.90\n1\n0\n4\n2\n    19.2\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.30\n1\n0\n4\n4\n    17.8\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.90\n1\n0\n4\n4\n    16.4\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n4.070\n17.40\n0\n0\n3\n3\n    17.3\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.730\n17.60\n0\n0\n3\n3\n    15.2\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.780\n18.00\n0\n0\n3\n3\n    10.4\n8\n472.0\n205\n2.93\n5.250\n17.98\n0\n0\n3\n4\n    10.4\n8\n460.0\n215\n3.00\n5.424\n17.82\n0\n0\n3\n4\n    14.7\n8\n440.0\n230\n3.23\n5.345\n17.42\n0\n0\n3\n4\n    32.4\n4\n78.7\n66\n4.08\n2.200\n19.47\n1\n1\n4\n1\n    30.4\n4\n75.7\n52\n4.93\n1.615\n18.52\n1\n1\n4\n2\n    33.9\n4\n71.1\n65\n4.22\n1.835\n19.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n    21.5\n4\n120.1\n97\n3.70\n2.465\n20.01\n1\n0\n3\n1\n    15.5\n8\n318.0\n150\n2.76\n3.520\n16.87\n0\n0\n3\n2\n    15.2\n8\n304.0\n150\n3.15\n3.435\n17.30\n0\n0\n3\n2\n    13.3\n8\n350.0\n245\n3.73\n3.840\n15.41\n0\n0\n3\n4\n    19.2\n8\n400.0\n175\n3.08\n3.845\n17.05\n0\n0\n3\n2\n    27.3\n4\n79.0\n66\n4.08\n1.935\n18.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n    26.0\n4\n120.3\n91\n4.43\n2.140\n16.70\n0\n1\n5\n2\n    30.4\n4\n95.1\n113\n3.77\n1.513\n16.90\n1\n1\n5\n2\n    15.8\n8\n351.0\n264\n4.22\n3.170\n14.50\n0\n1\n5\n4\n    19.7\n6\n145.0\n175\n3.62\n2.770\n15.50\n0\n1\n5\n6\n    15.0\n8\n301.0\n335\n3.54\n3.570\n14.60\n0\n1\n5\n8\n    21.4\n4\n121.0\n109\n4.11\n2.780\n18.60\n1\n1\n4\n2"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this section, our focus is on the discussion of keywords like STEM within topics such as xxstem, LadiesofScience, womenEngineers, AskWomen, AskFeminists, and Feminism to understand conversations taken place via comments and submissions.\nWe collected and preprocessed submissions and comments related to Women in STEM. The data preprocessing process includes cleaning the text, removing stop words, and tokenizing the data. We performed keyword analysis, TF-IDF score analysis, and sentiment analysis for comments and submissions data. Additionally, we visualize the results of our analysis through word clouds and line graphs depicting average distribution of texts in each subreddit for submissions and comments data.\nWe introduce external demographic data from the NSF website called \"Diversity and STEM: Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities 2023\". This allows us to intergrate the results from the internet as well as from the real world and allows us to identify similarities between the focus of what is being said on the internet and what is happening in the real world.\n\n\n\nWe recently combined Reddit data with external demographic data to conduct a thorough analysis. Using this method, we were able to get more insight into how different demographic groups are represented and involved in STEM fields as they are discussed on Reddit platforms.\nWe gathered an extensive dataset from subreddits that addresses issues related to women in STEM. Demographic information about labor force participation and STEM field representation was provided by the external data. Important demographic categories like gender, race, and disability status are included in this data.\n\n\n\n\nThe thorough investigation that combines external demographic data with Reddit discussions provides insight into the status of racial and gender representation in STEM fields. Even though women are underrepresented in the workforce, there is a lot of discussion about female participation in STEM on Reddit. Talks also touch on the diversity of races and ethnicities, emphasizing the need for greater inclusion, particularly for White and Asian people. The information suggests that there is less participation and representation of people with disabilities in STEM fields. All things considered, the analysis highlights the community’s support for diversity and inclusion The integration of demographic data and online discourse offers a viewpoint on public opinion and actual inequalities in STEM fields.\n\n\n\nWe focused on preprocessing Reddit data, which involves a number of steps to organize and improve the text. To ensure uniformity and relevance, we started this process with text cleaning and normalization, which involved changing all of the text to lowercase, removing URLs, and removing non-alphabetic characters. To clean the text, we applied the PySpark User-Defined Function (UDF). After tokenizing it into individual words, non-contributory elements were filtered out by removing stop words, both common English stop words and others unique to our dataset.  In order to fully comprehend the content of each submission, we merged words from the title and the selftext. These steps were essential for laying the groundwork for NLP analysis and improving the quality of insights.\n\n\n\nWe create corresponding dummy variables by identifying significant keywords associated with particular topics. Two main areas of interest—education and color (ethnicity)—were given specific keywords. For education, keywords related to “school,” “university,” and “education” were chosen. Keywords related to color included “black,” “hispanic,” “asian,” and “ethnicity.” These keywords were specifically selected to capture the essence of the discussions around these themes.\n\n\n\nNext we want to analyze the word frequency in Comments and Submissions in Reddit data. The statistics of high-frequency words can tell us most intuitively about the topics discussed and the tone of the speech. We use word cloud to visualize the word frequency statistics, which can most directly reflect the frequency of words.\nTable 2.1: Most frequent terms - Comments Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn comments, “People” is the most frequent word, with 101,322 words. This may indicate that the discussion is mainly focused on social humanities. “Men” and “Women” also appear very frequently, with 62,763 and 51,089 occurrences respectively. The appearance of these high-frequency words is reasonable, after all, the topic itself is strongly related to people and gender. However, these high-frequency words do not contain words that can clearly convey emotions or feelings as we expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn submissions, “Women” is the most frequent word. This is in line with our expectations as we are exploring the topic of women ourselves. Other words that appear more frequently are “know”, “think”, “feel”, “plan”, “work”, “time”, etc. may indicate that the topic of these posts is some personal sharing or discussion about the future.\n\n\n\nChanges in average text length over time can often reflect the depth of user engagement in a topic. So we grouped them by subreddit, calculated the average length of submissions and comments over time, and then visualized them using a line graph.\nFigure 3.1: Average Comments Length Per Subreddit\n\n\nFrom the graph, we can clearly see that the average comment length of “xxstem” is the most volatile, and there is a clear peak in the average text length of “xxstem” topics around January 2022, but it quickly falls back to the previous trend. The average comment length of “AskWomen” is the highest during the time period of the data, and the average comment lengths of the rest of the subreddits do not change significantly in general. The general trend in “AskWomen” is indicative of users’ tendency to post longer comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n“xxstem fluctuates more significantly in submissions, with a more pronounced peak in both July. And this period is more in line with the start of the school season as well as the job search season, which could mean that there is more active discussion of STEM during the job search or school start periods.” The average submission lengths for “Feminism,” “womenEngineers,” and “LadiesOfScience” fluctuated, but did not show a clear long-term upward or downward trend.\n\n\n\nWe went on to analyze the TF-IDF score, which is a common metric in Natural Language Processing tasks that helps us to be more aware of unique and important terms in the data. The results of the TF-IDF score are more reflective of the importance of the word than the word frequency analysis. The higher the score, the more important and unique the term is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the word “career” has the highest score in the comments, which is in line with our expectation that the consideration of future career is an important aspect of the topic of stem. Secondly, “opinion” and “life” may also indicate that the comments focus on sharing experiences in one’s life as well as some life advice. In addition, the word “hard” may also indicate the attitude towards stem itself and related careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe words “career”, “fresh”, “harass” and “wrong” had the highest TF-IDF scores in the submissions. This probably reflects the fact that submission’s focus is more on personal care and relationship issues.\nSome terms like “wrong” and “misunderstand” appear in both comments and submissions with high TF-IDF scores, highlighting common themes of conversations in both types of content.\n\n\n\nIn the sentiment analysis session, we used various models and pipelines in Spark NLP to analyze the sentiment of the textual content in the submissions and comments data, which gives us an idea of the sentiment tone of the users on the topic of women in STEM. We used three sentiment analysis models Vivekn, IMDB and Twitter to analyze the data in submissions and comments respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMDB: For the comments, the majority are positive (51.685%), with negative comments close behind (47.143%) and very few neutrals (1.171%).For the submissions, more negative (56.33%) than positive (42.781%), with an even smaller proportion of neutrals (0.89%).\nTwitter: For the comments, similar to IMDB, the majority are positive (51.407%), with a significant amount of negative sentiment (43.632%) and a slightly larger neutral category (4.961%) than IMDB.The submissions display a higher negativity (55.885%) compared to positivity (40.967%), with a small neutral segment (3.148%).\nVivek: The comments shows a more balanced sentiment, with positives (47.351%) and negatives (51.639%) being quite close and neutrals (1.01%) slightly less than IMDB. On the other hand, the submissions have a balanced distribution between positive (47.765%) and negative (51.129%) sentiments with neutrals (1.106%) comparable to the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor both comments and submissions, Twitter and IMDB have a higher positivity rate than “Vivek”, but “Vivek” has a more balanced sentiment distribution. Submissions are generally more negative than comments across all platforms. Neutral sentiments are the least common across both types of content and all platforms."

    "text": "Focusing on Women's Issues in STEM through Reddit Data\n\n\n\nBackground\nThe background of this project is rooted in the historical context of gender representation within the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). These fields have traditionally been dominated by men, leading to significant underrepresentation of women and other gender minorities. This gender imbalance has multifaceted implications, ranging from the workplace environment to the types of research and innovation pursued. Here’s an elaboration on this context:\n\nHistorical Underrepresentation: Traditionally, STEM fields have seen a lower participation rate of women and gender minorities. This can be attributed to various factors including societal stereotypes, lack of role models, and systemic barriers within education and employment in these fields. The historical context sets the stage for understanding current challenges and the need for change.\nChanging Perspectives and Initiatives: In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift towards recognizing and addressing the gender gap in STEM. This change is driven by both grassroots advocacy and institutional initiatives. Efforts include promoting STEM education among girls, implementing policies for gender equality in workplaces, and increasing the visibility of women and gender minorities in these fields.\nRole of Online Platforms in Public Discourse: Platforms like Reddit have become crucial in understanding public discourse on these issues. They offer unfiltered insights into people’s opinions, experiences, and attitudes. The anonymity and diversity of online platforms allow for a wide range of perspectives, including those from individuals directly involved in STEM fields and those observing from the outside.\nRevealing Challenges: Online discussions often highlight the ongoing challenges faced by women and gender minorities in STEM. These include experiences of bias and discrimination, difficulties in career advancement, and challenges in achieving work-life balance. Such candid conversations provide real-life examples of the barriers that still exist despite the progress made.\nTracking Progress and Shifts in Attitudes: These platforms also serve as a barometer for measuring shifts in societal attitudes towards gender diversity in STEM. Positive stories of success and support, debates on policies, and discussions about the importance of diversity in driving innovation are all indicators of changing perceptions.\nInfluencing Policy and Cultural Changes: The discourse on platforms like Reddit not only reflects societal attitudes but can also influence them. It can inform policymakers, educators, and industry leaders about the ground realities, helping shape more effective and inclusive policies and practices.\n\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this project is multi-dimensional, focusing on a comprehensive analysis of discussions about women and gender minorities in STEM fields, specifically within the context of Reddit. The core goals and areas of exploration include:\n\nUnderstanding Representation: One of the primary objectives is to assess how women and gender minorities are represented in discussions within STEM-related subreddits. This involves examining the frequency and context in which these groups are mentioned and discussed. The aim is to identify whether their representation is proportionate and respectful, and to uncover any patterns of underrepresentation or misrepresentation.\nIdentifying Challenges: An important aspect of the project is to uncover the specific challenges faced by women and gender minorities in STEM as voiced by the Reddit community. This may include issues such as gender bias in the workplace, barriers to career advancement, work-life balance concerns, and the experiences of discrimination or harassment. Understanding these challenges is crucial for developing strategies to address them.\nAnalyzing Perceptions and Sentiments: The project seeks to analyze the overall sentiment of discussions related to women and gender minorities in STEM. This involves using NLP techniques to gauge whether the discourse is predominantly positive, negative, or neutral. By doing so, we can gain insights into the general perceptions of these groups within the STEM community and identify areas where attitudes may need to be shifted.\nEvaluating Community Engagement: By examining the level and nature of engagement in these discussions (such as the frequency of posts, comments, and the extent of user participation), we aim to understand how actively the Reddit community engages with issues related to gender in STEM. This can indicate the level of interest and concern among community members about these topics.\nContributing to Broader Understanding of Gender Dynamics: The findings from this analysis will contribute to a broader understanding of gender dynamics in STEM fields. By providing a detailed picture of the current state of discussions around women and gender minorities in STEM, the project can inform academics, industry professionals, and policymakers about the prevailing attitudes and challenges.

Combine this with sentiment analysis to assess the overall sentiment for each topic. Visualize the popularity and sentiment using a word cloud, where the size of the text represents the frequency of the popular words in the comments.\nTopic 4: Identifying Core Contributors in STEM Discussions\nBusiness Goal: Uncover the most active and influential authors contributing to discussions on women’s issues in STEM, to foster community engagement and recognize key voices.\nTechnical Proposal: Merge the datasets for comments and submissions and use data aggregation techniques to count the number of contributions per author. Identify common authors between the two datasets to ascertain individuals who are both starting conversations and engaging with others’ content. Apply data visualization tools to display the distribution of contributions and highlight the top contributors. Analyze the patterns of these core contributors to understand their impact on the community.\nTopic 5: Analysis of Peak Activity Times\nBusiness Goal: Identify the times when users are most active in STEM-related discussions to optimize the scheduling of content and moderation resources.\nTechnical Proposal: Use time series analysis to determine peak activity periods by analyzing post and comment timestamps. Perform ANOVA tests to find statistically significant differences in activity levels across different times.\nTopic 6: Sentiment Analysis on Comments\nBusiness Goal: Gauge the general sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the community towards women’s issues in STEM.\nTechnical Proposal: Apply sentiment analysis algorithms to the body of comments. Aggregate sentiment scores by subreddit and over time to see how community sentiment varies across different forums and temporal dimensions.\nTopic 7: Content Effectiveness by Authorship\nBusiness Goal: Understand the impact of anonymous versus known user contributions on the discussion effectiveness and engagement.\nTechnical Proposal: Compare engagement metrics for posts authored by [deleted] users against those by users with known handles. Use statistical analysis to measure the difference in engagement.\nTopic 8: Common Challenges Highlighted\nBusiness Objective: Determine the principal obstacles encountered by women in STEM, as delineated in discussions across these subreddits.\nTechnical Proposal: Implement TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) analysis to identify and emphasize recurrent themes regarding challenges. Apply TF-IDF to enhance the specificity of keyword extraction, ensuring that common but less informative words are weighted lower than more distinctive words that are likely to be related to the unique challenges faced by women in STEM.\nTopic 9: Impact of Moderation on Discussion Quality\nBusiness Goal: Assess the impact of post removal (moderation) on the quality and direction of discussions.\nTechnical Proposal: Analyze the correlation between posts marked [removed] or [deleted] and the subsequent number of comments. Use NLP to compare the content of moderated versus unmoderated posts.\nTopic 10: Machine Learning to Predict Discussion Popularity\nBusiness Goal: Predict the potential popularity of a discussion topic based on initial engagement and content features.\nTechnical Proposal: Build a machine learning model using features like time of post, initial engagement, author’s historical engagement, post length, and keyword analysis to predict future engagement. Use regression models for numerical engagement prediction or classification models for high/low engagement.\n\n\nProject made by"

By plotting these two variables against each other and computing their correlation coefficient, we can understand how the content’s length might influence user engagement in terms of comments.\n\n\nThe correlation analysis between the number of comments and the length of self-text in Reddit submissions reveals a relatively weak positive correlation, as indicated by a correlation coefficient of 0.1. This suggests a slight tendency for posts with longer self-text to attract a marginally higher number of comments, but the relationship is not strongly pronounced. The majority of data points are concentrated within a specific range — with self-text lengths mostly between 0 to 10,000 characters and the number of comments typically ranging from 0 to 600. This concentration suggests that most Reddit submissions are relatively concise, and the corresponding comments are within a moderate count. The plot likely shows a cloud of points with no distinct linear pattern, reflecting the weak correlation. The spread of points across the plot indicates the variability in how different lengths of self-text correlate with the number of comments. For content creators and community managers, the weak correlation suggests that focusing solely on the length of posts may not be a significant factor in driving engagement, as measured by the number of comments."

This examination is crucial for gauging how actively users engage with content in various subreddit communities. Submissions were grouped by subreddit, with the number of comments per submission collected and aggregated. For each subreddit, a histogram was created to represent the frequency distribution of the number of comments. These histograms were initially set to be invisible to manage the plot’s clarity.\n\n\nThe analysis of the histogram distributions for each subreddit reveals insightful trends and disparities in user engagement, particularly in terms of the frequency and volume of comments per submission.\n\nr/xxstem:\n\nLow to Moderate Engagement: A significant number of users (273) commented between 0-1 times, indicating a prevalence of minimal engagement.\nPeak Engagement: The chart shows that the highest engagement, albeit rare, reached up to 47 comments per submission, demonstrating instances of higher interaction.\n\nr/Feminism:\n\nBroad Range of Engagement: The subreddit exhibits a wider range of engagement, with 734 people commenting 0-1 times.\nHigh Engagement Instances: Some submissions received a maximum of 250 comments, highlighting particular topics or posts that resonated strongly with the community.\n\nr/AskWomen and r/AskFeminists:\n\nHigh Engagement Levels: These subreddits showcased the highest levels of engagement among the analyzed groups. This suggests that these communities are highly active, with numerous users participating in discussions.\n\nr/LadiesofScience:\n\nLower Engagement: This subreddit exhibited the lowest engagement levels, as indicated by the lower frequency and volume of comments per submission.\n\nThe varying levels of engagement across these subreddits reflect different community dynamics and interests. Subreddits like r/AskWomen and r/AskFeminists likely foster environments that encourage more active participation and discussion. The higher engagement in certain subreddits may also indicate that the content or topics discussed are more resonant or provocative, prompting more users to comment. For content creators or community managers, these insights can guide strategies for engagement, content creation, and community building. Understanding which subreddits have higher engagement can help in targeting content more effectively. The histogram distributions provide a clear visual representation of engagement levels across various subreddits. They highlight not only the frequency of comments but also the intensity of interaction within each community. This analysis is pivotal for understanding the social dynamics of these online communities and can inform strategies for engagement and content optimization."

The “AskWomen” subreddit appears to have a generally increasing trend in average submission length over time. “AskFeminists” has a relatively steady average submission length, with a notable peak around October 2021. “Feminism,” “womenEngineers,” and “LadiesOfScience” show fluctuations in average submission length but do not exhibit any consistent long-term upward or downward trends. The patterns are irregular, with no single trend dominating across all the subreddits, suggesting that the dynamics of submission lengths are quite different from those of comment lengths."

This large­ number highlights how key this topic is in discussions about women’s issue­s on Reddit. A considerable slice, pre­cisely a fifth of all submissions, touch on gender e­quality. This shows it’s a key topic of interest. This mirrors the­ current discussions about feminism and the aim for the­ same rights and chances for women. With 9.5% of all re­ports, workplace discrimination is a main concern. This number shows the­ tough times women encounte­r in work situations. This includes being treate­d differently, facing bias, and hurdles to moving up in the­ir careers.\nComments Dataset: Just like in the submissions posts, e­ducation holds a large part of the comments. With 37% of the­ talk, it shows a community’s deep dedication to e­ducation issues that impact women. Around one-third of the­ remarks (28%) discuss race and ethnicity issue­s, or the “Color” topic. This large portion shows how gende­r, race, and ethnic identitie­s cross paths. It highlights the varying experie­nces of women from distinct backgrounds. Conversations about getting hitched and splitting up make up 14% of all re­marks, showing a big curiosity in the personal and lawful sides of the­se subjects.\nThe re­port underlines major points relating to wome­n’s problems, especially whe­n it comes to education. Both submitted conte­nt and comments often mention its importance­ for women’s rights and power. Color and race also ge­t much spotlight in comments, suggesting Reddit use­rs are insightful about the complex laye­rs of women’s lives involving both race and e­thnicity.

    "text": "Question 1: You describe the process of getting subreddit data by saying “The process of compiling our dataset from Reddit was conducted with meticulous attention to detail and a targeted focus.”, but we are curious how you went about finding these subreddits and perhaps if there were any that you ultimately decided to not include?\nResponse: When picking subreddits for our data, we first spotted a variety of subreddits with attention to user involvement and content significance. But we ruled out some subreddits because of less activity, scant content, or moral issues. We kept our data’s pertinence and wholeness, and stuck to research norms which were within the interest of our topic.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: We think it may be helpful to the reader to clearly categorize which questions fall under which category (EDA vs NLP vs ML), but this is up to you. All of these goals are relevant to your topic and will provide great findings to discuss. Our most common criticism of them is just to add some clarification here and there. Great work!\nResponse: Thank you for your suggestion, we have modified our Summary page to catgorize the business goals. Additionally, we have updated our Business Goals to make them more crisp and clear as per your feedback :)\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: Make clear to reader whether Moderators can be in the top X# of frequent posters or not. Their inclusion could be of no benefit, since moderators sometimes have to post often.\nResponse: We skip moderator information in our evaluation because we’re examining only user dialogue, not supervisory roles. Digging into moderator details can get tangled and does not line up with our main study goals.\nQuestion 4: Is it possible to include with the submission length statistics table, the type of posts? Meaning Image vs Text vs Link to another site. It may not be, but we think it would be worthwhile to mention it.\nResponse: While doing this might have been insightful, we wanted an overview of the text only since it would set the stage for going forward with Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques.\nQuestion 5: Possibly break down WordClouds by subreddit of interest? Perhaps you all have investigated this already. It may add more visuals to look at without providing any more meaningful findings, but it’s a thought.\nResponse: Thank you for this feedback. We did create WordClouds for each subreddit to unravel new words in conversation but since they were similar, we decided to make a WordCloud for the aggregate text of comments and submissions respectively. We have now discarded the WordClouds from our EDA page and created new WordClouds on our NLP page after data preprocessing to get a better understanding of conversations in Reddit for Women in STEM.\nQuestion 6: Pie Chart Legend Category colors between Comments vs Submissions. This may not be easy to fix. If it can’t be done, you may want to point out to the reader to pay attention to each category’s color and not flip quickly back and forth to draw conclusions.\nResponse: Thank you for your insight, I have modified the piechart so that the Legend Categories have the same color scheme for both comments and submissions data.\n\n\n\nNo Feedback Provided.\n\n\n\nNo Feedback Provided."

    "text": "K-Means Clustering\nFirst we filter and pick the subreddit “xxstem”. Then, we use the altered features in a K-Means clustering process, which forms 3 groups from the comments. K-Means, a sought-after method, divides data into clusters. Each comment associates with the cluster that has the nearest mean value. We set up a Pipeline. This contains all steps: vectorization, TF-IDF, and K-Means clustering. Train the model on the comments data. The model then predicts each comment’s belonging cluster. Next is checking how good the clustering is. We use the Silhouette Score - a score that shows how similar a comment is to its own cluster versus others."

    "text": "On this project, we explored conversations about women in STEM. We used extensive data from Reddit and additional information from the NSF site called “Diversity and STEM: Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities 2023”. Our journey started with collecting and preparing data from subreddits linked to women in STEM. We scrutinized the comments and data submissions through preliminary data analysis, employed NLP techniques, by text cleaning, tokenization, and TF-IDF analysis and went forward with various Machine Learning Techniques to answer our Business Goals. Our analysis from submission length statistics to clustering analysis, provides a comprehensive view of the community’s conversations.\nWe expanded our analysis to include unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically clustering analysis to enhance the depth and breadth of our project. This addition aligns with our evolving business goals, aiming to uncover underlying patterns and groupings in our dataset that may not be immediately apparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngagement Patterns: Our time-series and hourly analyses reveals distinct patterns in community engagement, with notable peaks in certain subreddits and times. Users were most active between 4PM to 5PM as noticed in our hourly analysis and least active on the weekends as per our day wise analysis.\nKeyword Insights: Keyword Discoveries: Examining keywords and visualizing them on word clouds provided perspective into common ideas extracted from entries and remarks made by females and minorities in the STEM fields. Words such as “incorrect” and “misinterpret” frequently show up in both comments and submissions, analyzed by high TF-IDF scores.\nSentiment Trends: Sentiment analysis across different platforms highlighted a spectrum of emotions, from positive to negative, underscoring the complex experiences of individuals in these fields. In both comments and submissions, Twitter and IMDB have higher positive sentiment rates but Vivek has a more balanced distribution of sentiment.\nSubreddit Classification Accuracy: Using various classification models, we successfully predicted the subreddit origins of submissions based on their textual content. The Logistic Regression model stood out for its balanced performance, effectively classifying text into correct subreddits with high precision and recall.\nClustering of Discussion Topics: Through K-Means clustering, we identified distinct groupings in the textual data. The application of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on these clusters illustrated how certain topics were closely related, while others were more dispersed.\n\n\n\n\nWith limited time, our project faced certain roadblocks. However, there’s plenty of room to go forward Here’s how we could continue forward:\n\nBroader Data Sources: We can incorporate more diverse data sources, such as professional forums or surveys, could enrich our understanding. Additionally, we can find more reddit subreddits linked to Women in STEM to get a bigger spectrum of Reddit conversations.\nLongitudinal Study: Tracking these discussions over a longer period could reveal evolving trends and the impact of societal shifts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is evidence of the ability of data to reveal the realities faced by women in STEM fields. It not only draws attention to the problems but also clears the path for defensible choices and actions. Even though we’ve come a long way, there is still more work to be done to achieve gender equity in STEM fields, and our work is an important piece of the puzzle."

    "text": "Question 3: Make clear to reader whether Moderators can be in the top X# of frequent posters or not. Their inclusion could be of no benefit, since moderators sometimes have to post often.\nResponse: We skip moderator information in our evaluation because we’re examining only user dialogue, not supervisory roles. Digging into moderator details can get tangled and does not line up with our main study goals.\nQuestion 4: Is it possible to include with the submission length statistics table, the type of posts? Meaning Image vs Text vs Link to another site. It may not be, but we think it would be worthwhile to mention it.\nResponse: While doing this might have been insightful, we wanted an overview of the text only since it would set the stage for going forward with Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques.\nQuestion 5: Possibly break down WordClouds by subreddit of interest? Perhaps you all have investigated this already. It may add more visuals to look at without providing any more meaningful findings, but it’s a thought.\nResponse: Thank you for this feedback. We did create WordClouds for each subreddit to unravel new words in conversation but since they were similar, we decided to make a WordCloud for the aggregate text of comments and submissions respectively. We have now discarded the WordClouds from our EDA page and created new WordClouds on our NLP page after data preprocessing to get a better understanding of conversations in Reddit for Women in STEM.\nQuestion 6: Pie Chart Legend Category colors between Comments vs Submissions. This may not be easy to fix. If it can’t be done, you may want to point out to the reader to pay attention to each category’s color and not flip quickly back and forth to draw conclusions.\nResponse: Thank you for your insight, I have modified the piechart so that the Legend Categories have the same color scheme for both comments and submissions data."
