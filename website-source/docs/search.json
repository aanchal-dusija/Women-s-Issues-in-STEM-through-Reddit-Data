The columns are as follows:\n\nsubreddit: Similar to the comments dataset, this indicates the subreddit where the submission was posted.\nauthor: The username of the Reddit user who made the submission.\ntitle: The title of the Reddit post or submission.\nselftext: The body text of the submission. This is usually the main content of the post, often providing details or context beyond the title. In some posts (like image or link posts), this might be empty.\ncreated_utc: The timestamp for when the submission was created, in UTC format.\nnum_comments: The total number of comments that have been made in response to the submission. This is a good indicator of how much engagement or discussion a post has generated.\nscore: Similar to comments, this is the net score of the submission, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes."

These word clouds are generated from a comprehensive collection of text data, encompassing both comments and submissions across various subreddits focused on women’s issues in STEM.\nThese word clouds are not just aesthetic visualizations but powerful analytical tools. They distill large volumes of text data into easily interpretable formats, enabling us to quickly grasp the core topics of conversation. For researchers, community moderators, and social analysts, these insights are invaluable for understanding the pulse of online discussions and tailoring strategies for engagement and content creation accordingly.\n\nFor Submissions:\n\nThe word cloud for submissions distills the essence of topics being posted. It reveals the central themes around which submissions are centered, offering a snapshot of the subjects that are prompting discussions. The visualization of submission data emphasizes the driving forces behind content creation on these subreddits, providing a direct insight into the interests and concerns of the Reddit community in the context of women’s issues in STEM. The emphasis on words like “work” and “men,” alongside “women,” suggests a significant focus on gender dynamics in professional settings and societal roles. The presence of words like “know,” “think,” and “want” reflects the community’s inclination towards sharing knowledge, opinions, and desires, highlighting a vibrant exchange of ideas and perspectives.\n\n\nFor Comments:\n\nThe word cloud for comments provides a visual representation of the most frequently used words in the comments section. The larger the word in the cloud, the more frequently it appears in the dataset. This visualization helps us identify the key themes and topics that dominate user discussions. The exclusion of common stopwords, along with specific terms like “removed” and “deleted,” ensures that the word cloud is focused on meaningful content. This refined approach highlights the nuances in the conversations happening in the comments. he comments word cloud similarly underscores words such as “women,” “people,” “think,” “want,” “question,” “time,” and “work.” The recurrence of “question” signifies a high level of engagement and inquiry within the community, with users actively seeking or providing information and clarification. The overlap of words like “women,” “work,” and “think” in both comments and submissions points to a consistent dialogue about women’s roles and perceptions in society."

    "text": "Correlation Analysis\n\nNumber of Comments v/s Length of Self Text Submissions\nThe interactive scatter plot we created provides an insightful visualization of the relationship between the length of self-text in submissions and the number of comments they receive on Reddit. By plotting these two variables against each other and computing their correlation coefficient, we can understand how the content’s length might influence user engagement in terms of comments.\n\n\nThe correlation analysis between the number of comments and the length of self-text in Reddit submissions reveals a relatively weak positive correlation, as indicated by a correlation coefficient of 0.1. This suggests a slight tendency for posts with longer self-text to attract a marginally higher number of comments, but the relationship is not strongly pronounced. The majority of data points are concentrated within a specific range — with self-text lengths mostly between 0 to 10,000 characters and the number of comments typically ranging from 0 to 600. This concentration suggests that most Reddit submissions are relatively concise, and the corresponding comments are within a moderate count. The plot likely shows a cloud of points with no distinct linear pattern, reflecting the weak correlation. The spread of points across the plot indicates the variability in how different lengths of self-text correlate with the number of comments. For content creators and community managers, the weak correlation suggests that focusing solely on the length of posts may not be a significant factor in driving engagement, as measured by the number of comments."
